SSE ships with 120+ correlation searches spanning from basic SIEM to detecting advanced adversaries. Everything is mapped to the Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK. But we didn’t stop there! SSE includes all of the content from Enterprise Security, ES Content Update, and User Behavior Analytics, all mapped to the same frameworks and other filters as everything in the app. The Analytics Advisor shows gaps where you could immediately turn on detections for the data you already have. We even include a customized MITRE ATT&CK Matrix that overlays active detections and what is available to deploy with the data already onboard!\n\nLEARN SPLUNK FOR SECURITY\nWhether you’re new to Splunk or new to security, Splunk Security Essentials helps you get up to speed faster by providing you useful information at the right time. The detections in the app include line-by-line SPL documentation that show why they use the search commands they do, and each detection includes lots of context such as the security impact, how to implement it, how to respond when it fires, and known false positives.\n\nIMPROVE YOUR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT\nWe built a variety of tools into SSE to help your deployment be successful. The app enables you to understand your active security detections whether they're out-of-the-box, or custom content specific to your organization. The Data Introspection feature tracks what data is present in your environment and helps connect those products to the detections they enable. We'll even look at check your CIM compliance, data latency, and we’ll improve your ES installation with MITRE ATT&CK detail and a dashboard using the ES Risk Framework to find high risk users or systems.\n\nMEASURE YOUR ENVIRONMENT\nFor those of us more used to technical work, demonstrating the business value of security can be tricky. Splunk Security Essentials can help all users by enabling simple audit-friendly reports on enabled correlation searches (even including your custom content) and tying bytes of data ingest to the detections they power. Some customers have used the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix to justify bringing on new data sources, and SSE has dashboards that specifically let you show how you could fill gaps by bringing on new data sources.","access":"unrestricted","appinspect_passed":false,"path":"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/","install_method_distributed":"appmgmt_phase","install_method_single":"simple","created_by":{"username":"Splunk","display_name":"Splunk Inc."},"download_count":53422,"install_count":6771,"categories":["security_compliance"],"icon":"https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/15b24eee-09b5-11ea-abcc-02dfd068cf86.png","release":{"uid":14782,"app_name":"3.0.1","created_time":"2019-11-18T03:40:01+00:00","published_time":"2019-11-18T03:40:01+00:00","size":65439717,"md5":"7e66b5ffba5d96b38f19acc2b644a7e3","sha256":"9b31eb45f615383c73f0ad61ef0247f8655964a1ad0106b0cc13343c1e404104","passed_validation":true,"platform":"independent","notes":"3.0.1 Release Notes\n* Python3 Compatibility in anticipation of future Splunk releases\n* Numerous bug fixes\n* A Partner Framework","path":"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/release/3.0.1/download/","appinspect_status":false,"manifest":null,"product_compatibility":["Splunk Cloud","Splunk Enterprise"]},"archive_status":"live","is_archived":false},

You can inspect the assistant panels and underlying code to see how it all works.\n\nML Youtube Playlist http://tiny.cc/splunkmlvideos\nML Cheat Sheet http://tiny.cc/mltkcheatsheet\n\nAssistants:\n* Predict Numeric Fields (Linear Regression): e.g. predict median house values.\n* Predict Categorical Fields (Logistic Regression): e.g. predict customer churn.\n* Detect Numeric Outliers (distribution statistics): e.g. detect outliers in IT Ops data.\n* Detect Categorical Outliers (probabilistic measures): e.g. detect outliers in diabetes patient records.\n* Forecast Time Series: e.g. forecast data center growth and capacity planning.\n* Cluster Numeric Events: e.g. Cluster Hard Drives by SMART Metrics\n\nSmart Assistants (new assistants with revamped UI and better ml pipeline/experiment management):\n*Smart Forecasting Assistant (provides enhanced time-series analysis for users with little to no SPL knowledge and leverages the StateSpaceForecasting algorithm): e.g. forecasting app logons with special days\n\nAvailable on both on-premise and cloud.\n\nSplunk MLTK Container for TensorFlow™\nAccess the TensorFlow™ library through the Splunk MLTK Container for TensorFlow™ available through certified Splunk Professional Services. The container leverages your bespoke GPU hardware , connecting from your on-premise Splunk Enterprise deployment to run custom deep learning from SPL . Python expertise is required to create your own neural networks.\nAvailable only for on-premise customers. \n\nSplunk Community for MLTK Algorithms on GitHub\nCheck out our Open Source community on Github that lets you share your algorithms with the community of Splunk MLTK users or import one of the algorithms that have been shared by the community: https://github.com/splunk/mltk-algo-contrib\nAvailable only for on-premise customers.\n\nThe GitHub repo algorithms are also available as an app which provides access to custom algorithms. Cloud customers can use GitHub algorithms via this app and need to create a support ticket to have this installed:https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4403/","access":"unrestricted","appinspect_passed":false,"path":"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/","install_method_distributed":"assisted","install_method_single":"simple","created_by":{"username":"Splunk","display_name":"Splunk Inc."},"download_count":66615,"install_count":7114,"categories":["internet_of_things","utilities","business_analytics"],"icon":"https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/d4aa8f20-fce8-11e9-bb08-02dfd068cf86.png","release":{"uid":14363,"app_name":"5.0.0","created_time":"2019-10-18T03:57:40+00:00","published_time":"2019-10-18T03:57:40+00:00","size":15462799,"md5":"cbe905a3ba6122937f9776200af98a27","sha256":"77a6c3908ff7cbcd256037467797e115875b0d8f5059d11d19f2fca2eef9ab5f","passed_validation":true,"platform":"independent","notes":"","path":"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/release/5.0.0/download/","appinspect_status":false,"manifest":{"info":{"license":{"text":null,"name":"Splunk Software License Agreement","uri":"https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-software-license-agreement.html"},"releaseNotes":{"text":null,"name":"Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit Release Notes","uri":"http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/latest/User/Whatsnew"},"description":"Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit","classification":{"developmentStatus":null,"categories":["IoT & Industrial Data"," Utilities"," Business Analytics"],"intendedAudience":null},"author":[{"company":null,"name":"Splunk","email":"mlsupport@splunk.com"}],"commonInformationModels":null,"app_name":"Splunk_ML_Toolkit","releaseDate":null,"privacyPolicy":{"text":null,"name":null,"uri":null},"id":{"version":"5.0.0","group":null,"name":"Splunk_ML_Toolkit"}},"platformRequirements":{"splunk":{"Enterprise":"6.5+"}},"incompatibleApps":null,"targetWorkloads":["_search_heads"],"tasks":null,"dependencies":{"Splunk_SA_Scientific_Python_linux_x86_64":{"targetOS":["_linux_x86_64"],"version":"1.3+","optional":true},"Splunk_SA_Scientific_Python_windows_x86_64":{"targetOS":["_windows"],"version":"1.3+","optional":true},"Splunk_SA_Scientific_Python_linux_x86":{"targetOS":["_linux_x86"],"version":"1.3+","optional":true},"Splunk_SA_Scientific_Python_darwin_x86_64":{"targetOS":["_mac"],"version":"1.3+","optional":true}},"schemaVersion":"2.0.0","supportedDeployments":["_standalone","_distributed","_search_head_clustering"],"inputGroups":null},"product_compatibility":["Splunk Cloud","Splunk Enterprise"]},"archive_status":"live","is_archived":false},
