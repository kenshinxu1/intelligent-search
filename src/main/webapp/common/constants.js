SSE ships with 120+ correlation searches spanning from basic SIEM to detecting advanced adversaries. Everything is mapped to the Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK. But we didn’t stop there! SSE includes all of the content from Enterprise Security, ES Content Update, and User Behavior Analytics, all mapped to the same frameworks and other filters as everything in the app. The Analytics Advisor shows gaps where you could immediately turn on detections for the data you already have. We even include a customized MITRE ATT&CK Matrix that overlays active detections and what is available to deploy with the data already onboard!\n\nLEARN SPLUNK FOR SECURITY\nWhether you’re new to Splunk or new to security, Splunk Security Essentials helps you get up to speed faster by providing you useful information at the right time. The detections in the app include line-by-line SPL documentation that show why they use the search commands they do, and each detection includes lots of context such as the security impact, how to implement it, how to respond when it fires, and known false positives.\n\nIMPROVE YOUR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT\nWe built a variety of tools into SSE to help your deployment be successful. The app enables you to understand your active security detections whether they're out-of-the-box, or custom content specific to your organization. The Data Introspection feature tracks what data is present in your environment and helps connect those products to the detections they enable. We'll even look at check your CIM compliance, data latency, and we’ll improve your ES installation with MITRE ATT&CK detail and a dashboard using the ES Risk Framework to find high risk users or systems.\n\nMEASURE YOUR ENVIRONMENT\nFor those of us more used to technical work, demonstrating the business value of security can be tricky. Splunk Security Essentials can help all users by enabling simple audit-friendly reports on enabled correlation searches (even including your custom content) and tying bytes of data ingest to the detections they power. Some customers have used the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix to justify bringing on new data sources, and SSE has dashboards that specifically let you show how you could fill gaps by bringing on new data sources.","access":"unrestricted","appinspect_passed":false,"app_url":"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/","install_method_distributed":"appmgmt_phase","install_method_single":"simple","created_by":{"username":"Splunk","display_name":"Splunk Inc."},"download_count":53422,"install_count":6771,"categories":["security_compliance"],"icon":"https://cdn.apps.splunk.com/media/public/icons/15b24eee-09b5-11ea-abcc-02dfd068cf86.png","release":{"uid":14782,"app_name":"3.0.1","created_time":"2019-11-18T03:40:01+00:00","published_time":"2019-11-18T03:40:01+00:00","size":65439717,"md5":"7e66b5ffba5d96b38f19acc2b644a7e3","sha256":"9b31eb45f615383c73f0ad61ef0247f8655964a1ad0106b0cc13343c1e404104","passed_validation":true,"platform":"independent","notes":"3.0.1 Release Notes\n* Python3 Compatibility in anticipation of future Splunk releases\n* Numerous bug fixes\n* A Partner Framework","app_url":"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/release/3.0.1/download/","appinspect_status":false,"manifest":null,"product_compatibility":["Splunk Cloud","Splunk Enterprise"]},"archive_status":"live","is_archived":false},

During a preview period the Splunkbase listing can not reveal all these details. ** If you experience trouble installing the app with Cloud, we are here to help!! Reach out to mlsupport@splunk.com\n\nThe Splunk AI Assistant (preview) empowers users to search their data using plain English. Now you can write a prompt of what you want in plain English, and Splunk AI Assistant translates the request into query ideas that you can execute or build on, all within a familiar Splunk interface. Splunk AI Assistant also explains what a given SPL query is doing in plain English with a summary as well as a detailed breakdown of the query. \n\nUnder the hood, the Splunk AI Assistant uses generative AI to lower the barrier to using SPL. It provides a chat experience which is intuitive and simple. For new users, it reduces the learning curve for using SPL. Advanced users will find the assistant helpful in unlocking the power of SPL and understanding complex SPL queries.\n\nPlease note that:\n- The app collects data that can be used to fine tune the model\n- Please do not enter any data that is personally identifiable, confidential or otherwise sensitive\n- The preview app should not be installed in any compliance environment.\n\nThe app is supported by the development team which can be reached at mlsupport@splunk.com. \n\nBecause this app is in Preview, users will need to download the app from Splunk's Preview portal to sign up.\nhttps://voc.splunk.com/preview/aiassist","icon":"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/90715b1e-2268-11ee-aafd-56b98212505f.png","app_url":"https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6410","download_count":"2403","_time":"2024-05-14T13:28:49.000+08:00"}
