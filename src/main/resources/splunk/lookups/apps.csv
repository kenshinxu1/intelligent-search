DomainTools enables Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and security analysts to take domain observables from their network and connect them with other active domains on the Internet. Those connections inform risk assessments, help profile attackers, guide online fraud investigations, and map cyber activity to attacker infrastructure.

With the influx in events per second rising, organizations need the ability to execute high-volume queries with improved response times. The DomainTools App for Splunk delivers, with enrichment at scale and drill-down details to add context. Leveraging the DomainTools Iris and Farsight DNSDB datasets, users have immediate access to dozens of attributes attached to every domain event in Splunk, efficiently delivering event enrichment at scale. 

Domain Monitoring

SOCs and Security Analysts can leverage the DomainTools Iris Detect product in Splunk to discover and watch newly registered domains associated with any terms their organization currently monitors (such as a brand or company name), and to monitor domains and append domains to your allowlist (list of trusted domains) from the Domain Investigation workflow. 

Predictive Risk Scoring

DomainTools Risk Score gives teams with emerging threat hunting skills an instant advantage in
helping to identify and optionally alert on Splunk events with suspicious domains they would have otherwise missed. Individual component scores give experienced hunters the tools they need to refine their alerts and precisely target their resources. DomainTools Risk Score, including Proximity and Threat Profile classifiers, is available in both key-value stores and Splunk indexes.

Proven Capability for Enterprise Organizations

DomainTools’ proven solution for Splunk includes a cloud-certified Splunk Application that deploys on Splunk search heads in both standalone and clustered configurations, with and without Splunk Enterprise Security. Event sources can be customized to match the unique requirements of each environment.

DomainTools Capabilities in Splunk

Reduce MTTD
• Bulk enrichment of domains with meaningful context
• At-a-glance alerting and reporting of malicious network traffic 
• Domain monitoring using DomainTools Iris Detect

Reduce MTTR
• Discover newly registered domains and further enable monitoring
• Create a Splunk ES notable event in case a high-risk domain is observed
• Investigate connected infrastructure using Iris and Farsight Passive DNS

The DomainTools App works in parallel with Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) but does not depend on it.

To effectively reduce risk, you need to maximize your insight and control of all devices on your network. On average, Forescout customers discover over 25% more connected devices than they knew they had and can collect hundreds more contextual device properties than before. By combining Forescout's complete enterprise-wide device visibility, rich contextual device and network properties data and automated incident response capabilities with Splunk’s data correlation, analytics and incident management, security operations teams can dramatically reduce risk and increase operational efficiency by realizing numerous benefits including:
• Refine security policies by collecting and analyzing real-time device, user and network insight across managed and unmanaged connected devices, including IT, IoT, OT, BYOD and Guest, and regardless of device type or network tier.
• Enhance scope and accuracy of real-time analytics, long-term trend analysis and investigations
• Rapidly detect anomalies, vulnerabilities and threats
• More easily prioritize incidents by leveraging correlated contextual device and event data to prioritize incidents
• Automate closed-loop incident response workflows across the entire incident management lifecycle to immediately mitigate and remediate threats and provide a complete audit trail from incident detection to results of actions taken.

Integration of the Forescout platform with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.

This Forescout Adaptive Response Add-on supports the Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework as follows:
-The Forescout App for Splunk maintains a list of available actions from the Forescout platform. Splunk can instruct the Forescout platform to respond to potential threats by applying any of these actions to endpoints that match search/trend criteria.
-To complete the action flow, the Forescout platform reports the status of actions applied to endpoints.

This Splunk app will use git to track file changes on a schedule. It can then optionally push the changes to an external repository. This app is useful if you want to know what and when files change in your environment. Unfortunately this app won't tell you ""who"" made a change - but typically you can get a pretty good idea with the help of Splunk audit logs etc. 

Before each run, this app can run a btool dump of various conf files. This is important because individual savedsearches files reorder as they are updated through the UI, which makes diffs ugly. The btool dump is always in a consistent order.

When changes are detected, an email can be sent showing the list of changed files.

  * Automate taking action by triggering Bolt tasks from Actionable Alerts (Puppet Enterprise only, requires the Puppet Alert Actions add-on for Splunk).
  * Maintain an audit log of Bolt actions that were run.
  * Trend Puppet inventory and fact data over time.
  * Power example dashboards and searches on Puppet data.
  * Provide operational metrics and dashboards for your Puppet deployment.

Use cases:

  * Share Puppet's rich, detailed inventory and change data with other teams for searches, dashboards and alerts.
  * Trend data over time to track progress or detect issues.
  * Make decisions faster by automatically triggering gathering the information you need to make a decision after Splunk has recognized an issue (Puppet Enterprise only).
  * Resolve issues faster by automatically triggering remediations after Splunk has recognized an issue (Puppet Enterprise only).
  * Monitor the health of your Puppet deployment.
  * Log and audit what ad hoc actions were run.
  * If you also need to deploy, configure and manage Splunk forwarders there is a Puppet module for that available here (https://forge.puppet.com/puppet/splunk).

Included are:

  * Source types for Puppet summary reports, detailed reports, facts, PE orchestrator and activity events, as well as Puppet Bolt runs.
  * Actionable Alert to generate Puppet Detailed Reports on demand.

Stamus Networks develops advanced network threat detection and response solutions, including the Stamus Security Platform and the open source turnkey Suricata system, SELKS.

Stamus Security Platform is used by security practitioners worldwide to expose real threats to their critical assets, empower their team’s rapid response, and mitigate their organization's risk. Its network detection and response (NDR) analytics engine that sits atop a unique combination of network security monitoring (NSM), network intrusion detection (IDS) and organizational context allows users to quickly detect, investigate, and respond to threats and security policy violations (unauthorized activity).

The Stamus Networks App for Splunk allows Splunk Enterprise users to extract information and insights from both the Stamus  Security Platform and open source Suricata sensors. It provides dashboards and reports but also a set of commands to interact with Stamus Security Platform via its APIs.

This Splunk Essential for Predictive Maintenance is created for maintenance reliability leaders and engineers who are looking for ways to improve and optimize their current preventive maintenance program.  To do predictive maintenance right, you need to have the right amount of knowledge on how to process data and then apply machine learning techniques to achieve the desired results.   

Designed for interactive learning, this guide focuses on learning how to solve real problems with real data. Users are provided with details of the predictive maintenance methodology and performance data from airplane engine sensors and then asked to operationalize their analytics. 

The Splunk Essentials for Predictive Maintenance takes you through 4 stages of the analytics process.  Each stage covers :
    * Methodology - designed to cover essential analytics knowledge to practice predictive analytics
    * Step-by-step - designed to apply the knowledge to already included dataset.

       - Stage 1: Data collection and ingestion focuses on how you can easily use Splunk software to collect, store, and structure asset metrics (dataset from airplane jet engines included).
       - Stage 2: Data exploration covers key methods for pre-processing and exploring data to help you understand the type of data in use and the characteristics of the dataset, which is crucial for getting the desired outcome.
       - Stage 3: Analysis teaches you 3 key analysis options (Anomaly Detection, Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning) for performing predictive maintenance analysis. In the supervised learning section, there is a complete guide to training, creating, and applying machine learning prediction models to predictive maintenance datasets.
       - Stage 4: Operationalization teaches you how to apply the model to a broader implementation, and how to create reports and alerts for operational actions.

Swimlane's Adaptive Response Action can create Swimlane cases pre-populated with Splunk alert and notable event data. 

Configuration

You are able to send alert data to up to 3 separate Swimlane instances with each action.  This is provided so you can
conveniently push to produciton, staging, and development instances with one action.

The global configuration is where you will define the connection info and credentials for your Swimlane instances.
1. In the top left corner of the Splunk interface, open the *app* dropdown menu and select the *Swimlane* app.
2. You will see the configuration page where you can define the host, username, and password for up to 3 Swimlane 
instances.

Alert Configuration

1. Once you have created an alert, go to the alert page and click *Edit* next to the *Actions* field.
2. At the bottom of the window, select *Add Actions* -> *Push Alerts to Swimlane*, then fill out the 
fields appropriately. Setup instructions for `Custom Field Mappings` and `Automappings` are in the next section 

Mapping configuration

For the initial setup, use `Automapping`.
1. In the Swimlane application, Create a JSON field with the *field key* `splunkrawjson` and a multi-line text field with the 
*field key* `splunkfieldlist`.  These two fields can be used to see the data being pushed to Swimlane.
2. Trigger the alert so that the action runs, then check Swimlane to make sure records were created in
the desired application.  if no records were created, check the logs (described in the **Logging** section
below) to debug.
3. Open one of the records that was created in Swimlane.  The fields in `splunkfieldlist` are the fields that are
available for mapping.  You can use `splunkrawjson` to see the value each field contains.
4. For each field that you want to push to Swimlane, either use `Automappings` or `Custom Field Mappings` as
described below.

If you select to use `automapping`, Splunk fields will populate a Swimlane field with the same field key if
it exists.  This is the preferred method of mapping since you can still display the info however you want in 
Swimlane by setting the field display name.

All Swimlane field types are supported and Splunk fields containing lists will be properly translated into
list type fields in Swimlane.

Logging

To find logs in the Splunk search, use the following search string:

index=_internal OR index=cim_modactions OR index=* source=""*push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log""

To access the log file directly, it can be found at:

{Splunk root folder}/var/log/splunk/push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log

If multiple executions happen concurrently, you can distinguish which log message belongs to which execution using the `pid`
logged in each message

General logs that Splunk generates can be found by going to *settings* -> *Alert actions*, then clicking on

into Splunk following the Common Information Model (CIM). The add-on is designed to be compatible with Splunk 
Enterprise and Splunk Cloud with the use of a Universal Forwarder.

This Technology Add-On is intended to import asset and vulnerability findings from the InsightVM Platform without the use of the InsightVM console. The default configuration will import assets and vulnerabilities for devices that have been scanned since the last import run. Key functionality includes:
- Import all asset and vulnerability data when it runs for the first time
- Track previous import times to only import assets and their associated vulnerabilities that have been scanned in the time since the last import
- Vulnerabilities that are newly found or have been remediated will be imported as new events in Splunk and 
respectively assigned a status of ""new"" or ""remediated""
- Previously imported vulnerabilities that have not changed in status will not be imported as new events and will retain their `found` status
- An optional configuration that allows importing all data every run, or every X period of days.

The Rapid7 InsightVM Dashboard and Technology Add-On are recommended in place of the Nexpose Dashboard and Technology Add-On listed on Splunkbase for all InsightVM customers.

To effectively reduce risk, you need to maximize your insight and control of all devices on your network. On average, Forescout customers discover over 25% more connected devices than they knew they had and can collect hundreds more contextual device properties than before. By combining Forescout's complete enterprise-wide device visibility, rich contextual device and network properties data and automated incident response capabilities with Splunk’s data correlation, analytics and incident management, security operations teams can dramatically reduce risk and increase operational efficiency by realizing numerous benefits including:
• Refine security policies by collecting and analyzing real-time device, user and network insight across managed and unmanaged connected devices, including IT, IoT, OT, BYOD and Guest, and regardless of device type or network tier.
• Enhance scope and accuracy of real-time analytics, long-term trend analysis and investigations
• Rapidly detect anomalies, vulnerabilities and threats
• More easily prioritize incidents by leveraging correlated contextual device and event data to prioritize incidents
• Automate closed-loop incident response workflows across the entire incident management lifecycle to immediately mitigate and remediate threats and provide a complete audit trail from incident detection to results of actions taken.

Integration of the Forescout platform with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.

From there you can setup a dashboard/report/alert to monitor when your SSL certificates are about to expire.  This is a great tool for monitoring Splunk's Web / Frontend & Splunk's Daemon / Backend SSL certificates both if you've specified your own or if you're using the built in certificates.

Now supports automated discovery mode that finds the PEM files you're using to encrypt your Splunk traffic and indexes their expiration date.  Use the dashboard provided as an example to configure alerts, and never let a Splunk cert expire again!

The app provides users a formidable combination of Splunk Enterprise Security’s (ES) powerful analytics, Splunk SOAR’s automation and massive scale along with Mandiant industry-leading threat intelligence, security validation and incident response.

Splunk ingests Mandiant intelligence, performs correlation and analysis, and provides dashboards for visualization. When combined, Splunk and Mandiant enable security professionals to validate their security stack and analyze security events through the eyes of Mandiant cyber security experts.

Maximize Mandiant Advantage with Splunk:

- Mandiant Threat Intelligence delivers the latest threat research directly to the SOC, allowing security teams to quickly see and detect real-time adversary activity. This empowers organizations to better understand the adversary and their tradecraft to make informed decisions and take decisive action. Mandiant intelligence feeds provide insights into well-known malicious actors, malware families, and map to MITRE ATT&CK for strategic response.

- Mandiant Attack Surface Management enables comprehensive visibility of the extended enterprise, so security teams can proactively mitigate real-world threats. Attack Surface Management scans corporate assets and cloud resources daily and identifies application and service technologies. The module assesses risks to the organization, assigns severity, and provides information security teams can use within Splunk to remediate.

- Mandiant Digital Threat Monitoring delivers customized alerts on potential targeting and data or credential leaks. Triggered alerts from monitoring the surface, deep and dark web can be viewed in pre-configured charts via the Splunk visualization tool. These charts provide a high-level overview of alerts and bring what matters most to the forefront in Digital Threat Monitoring. 

- Mandiant Security Validation allows customers to gain confidence in their readiness to withstand cyber-attacks. Mandiant tests the efficacy of control points to block attacks and validates that event information is being sent to and triggering alerts in Splunk Enterprise Security. With Mandiant and Splunk continuously validating the effectiveness of their cybersecurity controls, customers will have real data on how security controls are performing, allowing them to optimize their environments and make the right investments for the future.

- In the face of a suspected or active breach, customers can use the integration between Mandiant Incident Response and Splunk to engage with Mandiant incident response experts with the click of a button. These experts can help customers build their incident response capabilities, respond to active breaches, and bolster their security operations to detect and respond to attacks in the future.",false,"Mandiant Advantage",mandiant,false,7421,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/44e27db0-985e-11ee-8a23-360a0ed4696f.png",6128,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",64,"",splunk,enterprise,"2021-10-07T19:36:20.164954Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_""--"",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[______""","Security, Fraud & Compliance","security_compliance",135,5,3,null,"app_data.json","_json",Q6HDP2WV94,,developer,,,none,"2024-01-04T13:28:34.766969Z",null

Why?
Splunk (as of the time of writing in January 2019) has no native ability to use version control on its knowledge objects.

The Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics contains the following components:

Splunk_TA_vmware_inframon - Runs a Python-based API data collection engine, collects data from VMware vSphere environment, and performs field extractions for VMware data.
SA-Hydra-inframon - Collects API-based data from vCenter. It schedules jobs and runs the worker processes on each data collection node.
Please install the Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics Indexes (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5602/) in order to define the indexes used by Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics. Follow the Install and Configure Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics Indexes (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/VMWmetricsindexes/CollectData). 

The packages ""SA-VMWIndex-inframon"", ""Splunk_TA_vcenter"" and ""Splunk_TA_esxilogs"" have been removed from Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics build and published as an individual Splunkbase App in order to make the add-on SSAI-compatible in the cloud environments.

If you would like to collect the vCenter logs from your environment, then install Splunk Add-on for vCenter Logs (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5601/) by following the steps mentioned in Install and Configure Splunk Add-on for vCenter Logs (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/VMWvcenterlogs/CollectData).

SIEM provides a centralized view for security teams to easily access and analyze security information from a large number of sources, and prioritize mitigation efforts based on risk profiles.

SIEM Integration is a comprehensive solution for capture, retention, and delivery of security information and events in real-time to SIEM applications. Customers using Kona Site Defender, Client Reputation, Web Application, or Bot Manager (BETA) can analyze security events generated on the Akamai platform and correlate them with security events generated from other sources.

System Requirements

Akamai’s Splunk Connector requires Oracle JRE 1.8+. Download the latest from the Oracle Java site (Java Platform, Standard Edition) or install it from a software distribution package on Linux.

You must have Java installed on the host running Splunk Enterprise https://java.com/en/download/

Also, check to make sure that splunk forwarder is NOT installed on your Splunk Enterprise host machine.

Proxy server

To access the SIEM API from behind a proxy server, ensure that your proxy:

whitelists the domains *.cloudsecurity.akamaiapis.net and *.luna.akamaiapis.net
does not interfere with HTTP request headers for those domains. If, due to a strict enterprise security policy, your proxy does change these headers, make sure that at a minimum you allow and don't change the Host and Authorization headers.

It has the ability to alert when hosts stop sending data into Splunk, as well as inspect the last time the final combination of data was received by Splunk.

If the arrival of the final log for the index/sourcetype/host combination is later than expected, the Broken Hosts App will send an alert. This allows for quick status detection of the hosts and fast issue resolution.

The Broken Hosts App for Splunk is the app for monitoring missing data in Splunk. The app’s three main objectives include:
1. Alerting when data is missing from Splunk in order to determine the cause.
2. Utilizing saved searches to facilitate rapid detection of the missing data.
3. Creating dashboards for visualization to help with further investigations.

Most administrators do not possess the specific expertise required to successfully design, deploy and configure a syslog server to properly work with Splunk at scale. Additionally, the traditional Universal Forwarder or Heavy Forwarder approach to syslog collection have several issues with scale and complexity. Some customers send syslog events directly to Splunk to avoid architecting a syslog server, which introduces further problems. To help customers address these issues, Splunk Connect For Syslog (SC4S) was developed, a Splunk open source community developed product.

Splunk Connect for Syslog is a containerized Syslog-ng server with a configuration framework designed to simplify getting syslog data into Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. This approach provides an agnostic solution allowing administrators to deploy using the container runtime environment of their choice. 

The benefits of Splunk Connect for Syslog include the following:
* Repeatable, Concise, and Prescriptive Splunk solution for syslog
* Removal of the UF reduces configuration and management effort
* Turnkey deployment via the SC4S container architecture
* A library of data source filters we will be continually growing with the help of the community
* Exceptionally even event distribution across the Splunk Indexers (benefits search performance)
* Enhanced data enrichment beyond the standard Splunk metadata of timestamp, host, source, and sourcetype
* Easily add custom “filters” for additional sourcetypes beyond those supported out of the box
* Complete deployment documentation

Splunk Connect for Syslog is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. This unique product will be enhanced, maintained and supported by the community, led by Splunkers with deep subject matter expertise. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.

Log Hunting: Accelerate your hunt by narrowing down many logs to only the logs that matter.

Detections: Find and respond to off-port protocol usage, IOC matches, and other potentially interesting events.

Connections: Gain situational awareness using lists of top services, ports, dataflows, originators, and responders.

HTTP: Find suspicious HTTP transactions by reviewing a list of top host headers, originators, rare user agents and rare host headers.

DNS: Detect DNS exfiltration by spotting queries to non-existent domains and high connection counts.

Splunk SOAR streamlines security operations through the execution of digital “Playbooks” to achieve in seconds what may normally take minutes or hours to accomplish with the dozens of products that you use every day.

Splunk SOAR doesn’t replace existing security products, but instead makes your investment in them smarter, faster and stronger.

Whether troubleshooting individual calls or building high level reporting, it helps you visualize and understand in all areas: agents, users, and huntgroups; concurrency and utilization; call flow; call quality; call volume; devices; failed calls; locations and sites; and audits and compliance.

Your team can trust it as their day-to-day tool for navigating call data from your Cisco CallManager deployment, and it can also become their main tool for building custom reports, alerts and dashboards around that data. This is true whether it’s a standard report you’d expect or a custom report that nothing else has been able to provide.

Note that this isn't a package of content, but more a tank that allows you to drive around in your data.  You won’t find a leftnav full of canned CDR reports to click on (that ""don't quite fit"").  Instead, you get an open flexible framework to investigate anything, drill down into anything, report on anything, over anything, by anything (occasionally with hands-on help from Sideview Support =).

This app is designed for existing Splunk customers interested in migrating to Splunk Cloud, our Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. The app will assess your current Splunk Enterprise deployment that is running on-premises or in a bring your own license (BYOL) model and provide guidance for your migration to Splunk Cloud.

The high-level assessment captured by this app will also provide data points to help our Sales Engineering and PS Teams scope your migration efforts, implement best practices, and prioritize your migration success. For more detailed information on the compatibility of your apps, use the Analysis Of SplunkBase Apps for Splunk.

Note:
This App is self-documenting and will guide you through the experience.  Be sure to follow the in-App guidance.  The calculations in this app are meant to be directional and for educational purposes only.   Results are not guaranteed.

Installation:
This app can only evaluate the data that available in the search results. Therefore, this App should be installed on the Splunk Monitoring Console (MC).  The MC should have access to all Splunk servers in your environment.  This App is compatible with all versions of Splunk 6.5.x and above.  

Quick & Dirty:
Sometimes it is hard to get an App installed, or you might want to do some covert investigations.  To initiate these discussions with your Splunk Account team, run the following search from your Monitoring Console (MC) and save the results.  It is not nearly a complete assessment, but if we can only get the results from one search, this is it:

index=_audit search_id!=""'rsa_*"" search_id!=""'RemoteStorageRetrieveBuckets_*"" search_id!=""'searchparsetmp_*"" search_id!=""'remote_*"" search_id=* total_run_time earliest=-7d@d latest=@d

You can also run any one of the checks individually, which are listed under Tools -> Health Check Items.

The App includes Dashboards which will show you:
- The Top Talker IP's, MAC's, Protocols, Ports, VLANs, Conversations
- Detailed overview about IP Conversations, Packet Loss, TCP Error's, Round Trip Time
- Conversation Sankey Diagram (by Packets, by Bytes, by Destination Port) 
- Microburst Dashboard (Bit timechart)
- DNS Overview (Queries over time, Results over time, DNS Response Time)
- NFS Overview (NFS Operations, NFS Response time, NFS Errors)
- HTTP Overview (HTTP Methods, HTTP Status, HTTP Response Time)
- SMB / SMB2 Overview (SMB response time, SMB Operations)
- Keep Alive Communication Dashboards
- Hop Calculator between two IP's

In addition, following protocol fields are already extracted without a dashboard yet:
- MQ

In addition a ""Problem Detection"" Dashboard has been implemented to help during the Wireshark analysis. 

Welcome to the new version 5.x.x of SplunkForPCAP!
There are some important changes made to improve the user experience (compared to previous versions):
- A new python script is taking care about the convertion of your capture file. In the old version it was a shell / batch script depending on the OS
- The new version includes in the raw events the format of field=value - no extra parsing needed for the standard fields
- The converted capture file was before moved away from your initial location - now a new folder ""converted"" will be created in the same location of your capture file
- Starting from now also .pcapng files will be automatically converted - not only .pcap
- The new collection includes also the UDP port details
- The field names have changed for a better understanding


ROADMAP
- Support for more protocols and more use cases
- Dashboards will change to highlight the most important use cases for troubleshooting.

Announcement: 
This is a notice to inform you that support for Splunk Cloud Gateway will end on October 11, 2021.

We’re upgrading and improving the Splunk Mobile and Connected Experiences experience by replacing Splunk Cloud Gateway with a revamped and streamlined application called Splunk Secure Gateway. 

If you haven't done so already, we strongly recommend that you migrate from Splunk Cloud Gateway to the Splunk Secure Gateway app before the End of Support on October 11, 2021.

Splunk Enterprise 8.1 or higher and Splunk Cloud 8.1.2103 and higher already include Splunk Secure Gateway. Enable Splunk Secure Gateway and use the migration feature in the app to migrate your devices.

If your Splunk deployment is running versions below these Splunk platform versions, update your Splunk Cloud Gateway app to version 1.13.3 before October 11, 2021 to continue using the app without interruption.

This app, formerly known as the “Phantom App for Splunk,” is responsible for sending data from your Splunk Enterprise/Cloud instances to Splunk SOAR. Once that data is in Splunk SOAR, you can perform automated actions with over 350+ different security tools. 

Also included with this app is an integration with Splunk Enterprise Security, allowing you to send ES data to SOAR.

Splunk SOAR is a Security Automation and Orchestrated Response (SOAR) platform that integrates with your existing security tools in order to provide a layer of “connective tissue” between them. Splunk SOAR streamlines security operations through the execution of digital “Playbooks” to achieve in seconds what may normally take minutes or hours to accomplish with the dozens of products that you use every day.

Splunk SOAR doesn’t replace existing security products, but instead makes your investment in them smarter, faster and stronger.

(Formerly known as Phantom App for Splunk)

This means with the Splunk add-on for AWS v6.0.0, customers will be able to use a single Add-on across all AWS data sources for ingesting AWS data into Splunk. If you are using the Splunk Add-on for Kinesis Firehose as well as the Add-on for AWS with your Splunk instance, then you must uninstall the Kinesis Firehose Add-on before upgrading the Add-on for AWS to version 6.0.0 to avoid any data duplicacy and discrepancy issues. We encourage all customers who have a use case for Kinesis Firehose to adopt the Splunk Add-on for AWS v6.0.0 as soon as it is available as the Splunk Add-on for Kinesis Firehose will be discontinued in the future.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

After the Splunk platform indexes the events, you can analyze the data directly or using other Splunk apps, such as the Splunk App for AWS and Splunk Enterprise Security.

This application was built as there were a variety of messages in the Splunk console and logs in Splunk that if acted upon could have prevented an issue within the environment.

In addition to the alerts there are a few dashboards that relate to troubleshooting indexer/heavy forwarder performance issues.
Many of the alerts are informational and the description and comments inside the alert explain which alerts are likely to generate the most noise.
All alerts are disabled by default so you can choose which alerts may be appropriate for your environment.

Requirements:
This app relies on the data collected in the Unified Audit Log. 

There are several ways to export this data out of an environment:
1. Exporting the data using the Office 365 Extractor (https://github.com/PwC-IR/Office-365-Extractor) 
Full disclosure this app was built by a colleague and me. 
2. Getting the data from the API which can be achieved with the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Office 365 
3. Using the Office 365 Security and Compliance web portal

Dependencies:
The custom timeline app is used for one visualisation and can be found here:
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3120

Getting started:
- Update the macro `ual` to the index where your UAL data is stored.

UPDATE Mar 29, 2023

** The Upgrade Readiness App (URA) on Splunkbase is for ON-PREM ENVIRONMENTS ONLY. 
** CLOUD environments get new URA versions WITHIN SPLUNK CORE RELEASES. Upgrading URA ahead of Splunk Core Releases is not supported at this time.
---

The Upgrade Readiness App is an extension of the Splunk Python Upgrade Readiness App. In addition to scanning your deployment for features and code that might not work with Python 3, jQuery vulnerabilities, and 9.0 checks.

Use the Upgrade Readiness App to prepare your deployment for upgrade to Python 3, jQuery 3.5, and Splunk version 9.0 readiness. This app can scan Splunk apps installed on Splunk Enterprise version 7.3 and higher and Splunk Cloud Platform 8.2.2107 and higher.

The app's scan results describe the remediation actions you must take to ensure that your public and private apps work as expected after you are upgraded to a new version of Python on the Splunk platform, as well as actions you must take to remove dependency on vulnerable versions of jQuery. For example, scan results show if any apps and customizations rely on Python 2. This is important as support for Python 2 is being phased out of Splunk software.

On Splunk Cloud Platform, the Upgrade Readiness App provides these additional features:
     - Scan search heads and indexers and view a combined report from both types of instances.
     - Request an upgrade of the default Python version from Python 2 to Python 3.

The Upgrade Readiness App is a tool that assists you with your transition from Python 2 to Python 3, jQuery 3.5, and Splunk version 9.0 readiness. Even if your deployment passes all checks, you must still independently test your private and customized apps and add-ons for incompatibilities.

The Upgrade Readiness App comes with Splunk Enterprise 7.3 and higher, as well as Splunk Cloud Platform version 8.2.2109 and higher. You do not need to install the app on these versions of Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud Platform.

One of the core feature of UTBox is to correctly parse URLs and complicated TLDs (Top Level Domain) using the Mozilla Suffix List. Other functions like shannon entropy, counting, suites, meaning ratio, bayesian analysis, etc, are also available.

UTBox has firstly be created for security analysts but may fit other needs as it's a set of building blocks. Enterprise Security users will need to modify the import statement to use UTBox.

Custom Visualizations give you new interactive ways to visualize your data during search and investigation, and to better communicate results in dashboards and reports. After installing this app you’ll find a timeline visualization as an additional item in the visualization picker in Search and Dashboard.

A timeline visualization shows activity time intervals and discrete events for a resource set. Activity for each resource appears in a separate timeline lane. If an activity start time and duration are available for a particular resource, the timeline shows a duration interval as a horizontal bar in the lane. If only the start time is available, the timeline shows a circle at that time.

The Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit App delivers new SPL commands, custom visualizations, assistants, and examples to explore a variety of ml concepts. 

Each assistant includes end-to-end examples with datasets, plus the ability to apply the visualizations and SPL commands to your own data. You can inspect the assistant panels and underlying code to see how it all works.

Look for our ML Youtube Playlist for simple explanations of how to use MLTK and what it is for..

ML Cheat Sheet https://docs.splunk.com/images/3/3f/Splunk-MLTK-QuickRefGuide-2019-web.pdf

Assistants:
* Predict Numeric Fields (Linear Regression): e.g. predict median house values.
* Predict Categorical Fields (Logistic Regression): e.g. predict customer churn.
* Detect Numeric Outliers (distribution statistics): e.g. detect outliers in IT Ops data.
* Detect Categorical Outliers (probabilistic measures): e.g. detect outliers in diabetes patient records.
* Forecast Time Series: e.g. forecast data center growth and capacity planning.
* Cluster Numeric Events: e.g. Cluster Hard Drives by SMART Metrics

Smart Assistants (new assistants with revamped UI and better ml pipeline/experiment management):
*Smart Forecasting Assistant (provides enhanced time-series analysis for users with little to no SPL knowledge and leverages the StateSpaceForecasting algorithm): e.g. forecasting app logons with special days

Available on both on-premise and cloud.

Splunk App for Data Science and Deep Learning
The Splunk App for Data Science and Deep Learning (DSDL), formerly known as the Deep Learning Toolkit (DLTK), lets you integrate advanced custom machine learning and deep learning systems with the Splunk platform. The app extends the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) with prebuilt Docker containers for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and a collection of data science, NLP, and classical machine learning libraries. When you use the predefined workflows of Jupyter Lab Notebooks, the app enables you to build, test, and operationalize customized models with the Splunk platform. You can leverage GPUs for compute-intense training tasks and deploy models on CPU or GPU enabled containers.

Splunk Community for MLTK Algorithms on GitHub
Check out our Open Source community on Github that lets you share your algorithms with the community of Splunk MLTK users or import one of the algorithms that have been shared by the community: https://github.com/splunk/mltk-algo-contrib

The GitHub repo algorithms are also available as an app which provides access to custom algorithms. Cloud customers can use GitHub algorithms via this app and need to create a support ticket to have this installed:https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4403/

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on CCX Microsoft Windows Sources Extensions looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Windows log sources captured via Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows installed on Splunk agents (UF).

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/742/) but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sources:  

- XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational
- WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational
- WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

This listing includes the deprecated versions of the App up to v2.0.0. Later versions can be found here: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6752.  

To enable rule streaming, configure Jobs in the Continuous Content Management (CCM) module of the SOC Prime Platform and specify them in the App's data input. Jobs are configured with Content Lists to select rules for deployment, Presets to automatically modify the rules' parameters, and Filters to include additional conditions. You can also set up and apply Custom Field Mapping profiles to make the names of indexes, fields, and even field values in the rule code match your custom data schema.

To obtain rules via the CCM module and stream them into your environment, you need access to the SOC Prime CCM API.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on for Crowdstrike Products Extensions looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Crowdstrike log sources captured via the Add-on CrowdStrike Falcon Event Streams Technical Add-On or CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight Vulnerability Data.

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for CrowdStrike Falcon Event Streams (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5082/) or CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight Vulnerability Data (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6167) but works as an additonal extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes ""crowdstrike:spotlight:vulnerability:json"" and ""CrowdStrike:Event:Streams:JSON"" including the following log subtypes:  

- ActivityAuditEvent
- IdentityProtectionEvent
- CustomerIOCEvent
- IdpDetectionSummaryEvent
- IncidentSummaryEvent
- ScheduledReportNotificationEvent
- RemoteResponseSessionStartEvent
- RemoteResponseSessionEndEvent


Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

To configure an input after installing this app, go to Settings > Data Inputs > Mimecast Awareness Training - Campaigns  
You will need to supply the the following:  
- Grid or Tenant API URL  
- Access Key
- Secret Key
- App Id
- App Key
- Launch Date
  
Once the abovementioned credentials have been entered, click on More Settings and select your index and interval. Since this API endpoint returns data that do not change a lot, it is recommended to set a wide interval, such as ""every 12 hours"". This TA will only index events that are greater than the desired Launch Date.
  
NOTE: Do not change the `sourcetype` as there's a renaming that happens in the background / parsing phase.

Insights alerts administrators with timely warnings and/or suggested optimizations for the systems in your implementation, for example:

    Operations - an outage is about to occur
    Security - a new CVE is affecting your systems
    Business - overspending on resources is taking place

The application integration with Splunk either uses Insights APIs to collect data and perform tasks in a similar way to a client that you would create yourself, or subscribes to streams of Insights events. The method you use depends on your targeted use case.

Red Hat Insights application for Splunk forwards selected Insights events to Splunk. The application seamlessly integrates with Red Hat Insights, so that you can focus on handling the data on the Splunk application side, in the same way you manage other sources of data.

Insights is included as part of your Red Hat subscription, and is accessible through Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

Installation and initial configuration are automated, so setting up the integration is quick and simple.

If you have your own Neo4j graph database you can use the gsearch or gsearchgen command to read content from your existing graph database and combine that with information within Splunk. Be sure that the accounts for these searches are read_only. But the commands themselves do filter out neo4j [CREATE|DELETE|MERGE] commands.

Another app called ""Common Metadata Data Model""(itmip_neo4j_cmdm) is meant for:
- Synchronizing ServiceNow CMDB CIs and their relationships into a Neo4j graph database.
- Synchronizing ServiceNow Users and Groups (ITIL and config) into a Neo4j graph database.
- Synchronizing ServiceNow Incident, Changes and Problems and their relationships of CI's and Users/Groups into a Neo4j graph database.
- All ServiceNow classes/tables and fields are fully customizable through the WEB UI.
- Modular inputs for synchronizing Splunk data into a Neo4j graph database. This is a form of discovery but then the source is Splunk.
- new search commands for writing into a Neo4j graph database.
To use the ""Common Metadata Data Model""(itmip_neo4j_cmdm) a paid license is needed.

The CMDM app: https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5508/. If you have interest and want to know more please send an email to: eduard.lekanne@itmip.nl and I will be in contact with you.

Splunk Enterprise 8.x customers may continue to use the free version of Splunk DFS included with their Enterprise license. Version 1.1 is the final release of Splunk DFS, and version 1.2 is the final release of the accompanying Splunk DFS Manager app. There will be no additional major or minor releases of either product. Splunk DFS 1.1 and the Splunk DFS Manager app 1.2 will be supported until the October 22, 2021 end-of-support date of Splunk DFS 1.1. See the Splunk Software Support Policy for details.]

The Splunk DFS Manager app enables you to run Data Fabric Search (DFS). The app automatically bundles, installs, and configures Apache Spark that is required for DFS. Additionally, the app helps you to continuously and seamlessly manage, configure, and monitor your Spark cluster and customize the resource allocation within your DFS deployment from any search head through a scalable and adaptive user interface to run a DFS search.

Splunk DFS Manager installation and configuration:
    1) Decide how many workers are required.
    2) Provision nodes to run as workers. 
    3) Add the nodes as distributed search peers to the search head.
    4) Install the app on the search head and search peers.
        - For indexers in an indexer cluster: Install the app using a cluster master.
        - For search heads in a search head cluster:Install the app using a search head cluster deployer.
    5) DFSmaster automatically starts on the search head (in standalone mode) and on the search head captain in a search head cluster.
    6) Access the Splunk DFS manager UI on the search head that runs as the DFS master.
    7) Add the provisioned search peers as the DFS workers.
    8) Run a DFS search.
 
Splunk DFS Manager capabilities:
    - High availability that allows an alternate search head captain to restart the Spark master, in case the search head captain fails.
    - Customize resource usage by leveraging workload management (WLM) to allocate CPU and memory.
    - Add DFS workers on all or selected search peers.
    - Remove a DFS worker.
    - Restrict adding DFS workers to a particular site in a multi-site environment.
    - Monitor the health and resource usage of the Spark cluster.
    - Enable Spark security.",false,"Splunk Inc.",Splunk,false,848,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/1a7453f2-a74c-11ea-8203-0a9c9ef27d38.png",4745,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,true,"Splunk General Terms","Splunk General Terms","https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html","Splunk General Terms","https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2019-10-18T05:42:14.733122Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_"""",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[______""""_","IT Operations

Is the search properly structured? Is data source still being indexed? Are search time range and schedule coordinated? What if the runtime is longer than the interval between one run to the next?

You probably answered these questions while doing the once in a while alert review.

This task however, becomes a pain in no time when the number of alerts rises and, as a consultant, it is common to encounter a Splunk environment in which admins lost track of configured alerts with consequences such as alerts being missed and improper resources usage.

A more efficient way to keep track of active alerts would consist in reviewing them all once, and then only review the ones that have been modified since their last review.

This the purpose of this App: help admins to continuously maintain properly configured alerts.

    4) Click Install app from file.
		The Upload app page appears.
    5) Browse to and select the Splunk app file, and then click Upload.

Before You Begin:

    1) On the computer where the indexer peer nodes are configured, configure the receiving port.
		To configure the receiving port, from the Home page, navigate to Settings > Forwarding and receiving > Configure receiving > New Receiving Port.
    2) On the computer where the receiving port is configured, create a new index. You can also use an existing index if you have one on the computer where the receiving port is configured.
		To create a new index, from the Home page, navigate to Settings > Indexes > New Index.

Configurations:

    * Set up the CommCell page: On the CommCell tab, enter the webserver URL. Enter the CommCell user name and password, and then click Add CommCell.
		Append the webserver URL with the IIS port number, such as :. The default port number is 81.
		
    * Set up the Commvault Clients page: On the Commvault Clients tab, select a CommServe client, and then click Submit. From the Unmonitored Clients section, select the CommServe client and other    clients to monitor. Click Monitor Selected Clients.
	
	*	Set up the Splunk Configuration page: On the Splunk Configuration tab, from the IndexName list, select the name of an index. Enter the IP of the indexer and the receiving port number. Click Submit.

		If you have not installed the Splunk software on the Commvault client computer, depending on the operating system installed on the client computer, enter the Windows or UNIX path of the Splunk forwarder software. You must enter a .msi file path for Windows and a .tgz file path for UNIX.

		If you have another Splunk software running on a client computer, configure the outputs.conf file to point the forwarder to the computer where Splunk indexer is installed. Also, enter the credentials of the Splunk software in the Forwarder Configuration Table. Ensure that this client computer is a monitored client.

Result:

	On the Commvault Dashboard tab, you can see the pie charts of the duration and the status of Commvault jobs. Click the pie chart to get the job details. Click on a job ID to get the job logs.

Additional Information:

	To view the events for troubleshooting, you can check the SplunkPlugin.log file in the SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/commvault/local folder.

We harness the world’s most exclusive team of security researchers and give them access to a powerful platform for trusted security testing. That testing yields vulnerabilities, data to measure attack surfaces, and provides documentation to aid compliance.

The Synack App for Splunk provides an easy way to bring live, up-to-date Synack data into your Splunk environment. By putting IT, Security, and Synack-discovered vulnerability data in one place, richer reporting, analytics, custom dashboards and queries are available to reduce the effort and time to gain insights. It comes with an out-of-the-box dashboard, or users can customize their use of Synack data.  

Common use cases include:
• Security Operations - Integration of vulnerability data into the Security Operations Center (SOC) and related workflows enables security teams to get more efficient and streamline your security stack
• Threat Hunting - Find evidence of active or past threats using verified, Synack data about true exploitable vulnerabilities
• Incident Management - Efficiently bring incidents to conclusion using all available data sources
- Web logs: Correlate exploitable vulnerabilities & locations with web logs to determine if there are other locations where this vulnerability can be exploited
- IPS/IDS: Correlate exploitable vulnerabilities & locations with network traffic to define new rules for detection and prevention
- Scanners: Correlate exploitable vulnerabilities with scanner data for better scanner efficacy
- Threat Intel: Correlate exploitable vulnerabilities & locations with Threat intel to build out predictive patterns
• Custom Reporting & Analytics for the above scenarios, or other workflows in your security organization

In addition a new BALANCED savedsearch.conf file will be written LOCALLY in the app for a user to download and install in their Splunk Enterprise system if desired.

A balanced savedsearches.conf file will have the alerts and saved searches all running hourly using each of the 60 minutes in the hour to host an alert or alerts in the most resource conserving manner as possible.

If your Splunk Enterprise system is MISSING or SKIPPING alerts then this app is essential and will allow you to evaluate your alert schedule and optionally install a new balanced savedsearches.conf file which retains all of your alert settings. Just the timing is set to hourly for all your alerts.  This will save you DAYS of using the mouse and Splunk GUI to reschedule your alerts.

Give this app a try.
At least list out your alert schedule to an easily readable .csv file.

Currently, there seems to be no easy way to report on 
and dump out all all your alerts without clicking the mouse 1000+ times
 - especially if you have say 800+ alerts defined and running.

Wouldn't it be nice to have the ability to dump out
all of the Splunk alerts you defined to a .csv file and review all your alerts with Excel?

Now you can.

This app provides a way for an organization or an individual to convert user defined alerts
contained in internal splunk savedsearches.conf files to a user friendly readout provided by a .csv file.

When you save searches and create alerts - Splunk stores them for you in a number of savedsearches.conf files.

You may have alerts defined in only one savedsearches.conf file or in many 
savedsearches.conf files depending on if different users are defining their own alerts.

The work flow to dump out the alerts is fairly easy:

First install this app.

Then select the app.

Once the app is selected:

The app has a search bar.

Enter a search of "" |  exportalerts list"" (without the "")  to get a list of where your savedsearches.conf files are stored.
For a list of relative paths to your savedsearch.conf files enter ""| exportalerts list"". 

Then run the search again with ""| exportalerts PATH "".  Where the PATH is a path you have cut and pasted from 
the ""| exportalerts list"" search 

The "" | exportalerts list"" command or search will give you a list of one or more paths to the savedsearch.conf files relative to this app.

Highlight and cut or copy each line and paste it into the "" | exportalerts "" command as a suffix.

For example:

| exportalerts ../../search/local/savedsearches.conf

Would be a correct search string to cause the app to list your alerts defined in this particular savedsearches.conf file

And once you get a list of your alerts then:

Lastly save this search with all your alerts listed below as a REPORT. 
Then run the report and export as a csv file.

To export a report as a .csv file - look in the far upper right of the app screen for a downward pointing arrow
into a horizontal bar. This is the export / download to .CSV icon which you want to use from a REPORT.

You can only download to a .csv file when you SAVE your search as a report.

For example: You located a savedsearhes.conf file and you issued ""| exportalerts ../../username/savedsearches.conf"" file and you see alerts below. 

Next - open the report. You will see the alerts listed below in the report.

Go to the upper right menu bar of the report. Look for export and export to .csv. The symbol / icon is a downward arrow into a horizontal line.

You can name the .csv file and it starts to download from your browser.

Once the .csv file is downloaded to your desktop use Excel.

Select this app in the drop down. 
Then for help type in the search bar: ""| exportalerts help"" without the ""

This combination makes Q-Compliance the most complete compliance monitoring and reporting solution on the market.  Unlike legacy IT GRC tools––glorified databases to organize policies, paperwork, historical security posture snapshots, and status notes––Q-Compliance adds real-time measurement of your systems’ actual compliance states across all controls, and even automates system security plans. As such, Q-Compliance is the first solution to truly add operational security value to the paradigm of “check-box” compliance.

As the complete solution, Q-Compliance is centered around the NIST SP 800-53r4 Controls Catalogue, supporting use cases within the Commercial and Public Sector markets through  adoption of the NIST RMF or CSF.  

Furthermore, Q-Compliance includes workflows, overlays, and reports.

Failure insights provide proactive recommendations to fix connection failures within the environment. Citrix Analytics for Performance not only helps administrators easily spot which machines are overloaded but understand why there are issues. Self-service search allows for running queries to easily uncover trends within the rich data set. Lastly, Citrix Analytics for Performance aggregates multiple cloud-based and on-premises CVAD sites for a holistic view of performance across the environment. 

Citrix Analytics for Security aggregates and correlates information across network traffic, users, files and endpoints in Citrix environments. This generates actionable insights that enable Citrix administrators and security teams to remediate user security threats through automation while optimizing IT operations. Machine learning and artificial intelligence empowers Citrix Analytics for Security to identify and take automated action to prevent data exfiltration. While delivered as a cloud service, Citrix Analytics for Security can generate insights from resources located on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid architectures.

If they differ, the suggested change is shown in the ""definition_data"" field. There could be a difference because some data is no longer present and the macro could/should ""shrink"" or because there is new data and the macro could/should ""expand"" or perhaps you no longer have any data coming into Splunk that is tagged for your datamodel.  In the latter case, you need to investigate and if the data is still there, get it tagged correctly and if not, get it put back in, or if not, unaccelerate the datamodel.  Use the ""URL"" field (cut & paste to browser) to jump directly to edit any datamodel's index macro.

This app also contains a set of macros to greatly increase the flexibility and accuracy of SIEM drilldowns (there is an example correlation search that demonstrates this).

This app and the slide deck referenced below were developed independently, but there is a great deal of common concepts and overlap so it is a perfect primer:

SFA offers your fraud team a standardized workflow, extensive interactive visual investigation capabilities, and a robust risk-based alerting framework, which is completely customizable and extensible. 

Using the risk-based alerting framework, SFA uniquely provides fraud prevention teams the ability to improve alert fidelity and reduce false positives, ensuring that financial, legal, compliance, and reputational losses are minimized.

Splunk App for Fraud Analytics supports use cases and detections within Financial Services, Unemployment Insurance and Healthcare verticals.

Detections of fraud in Financial Services includes account takeovers, new accounts fraud, anti-money laundering and number of other use caaes.

Unemployment insurance fraud includes correlation searches and detections of three major indicators of fraud: impersonation, location deception and shared accounts.

Healthcare vertical includes detections of drug diversion and opioid mishandling. Essential detections includes attempts to access opioids forcefully, excessive number of anomalous transactions and discovery of more complex behavior patterns related to witness collusion during disposal of unused opioids.

All new and existing fraud use cases are supported with relevant dashboards and customized interactive investigator panels.

Note: 
The SFA app requires technical expertise. If you need assistance to troubleshoot the app’s framework, contact Splunk Support. If you need assistance to customize the app, contact your account team.

The goal of this tool is very simple: It brings all the Information you need to create CIM compliance TA or check an existent TA at one single point. That´s one main problem, to find all needed information because they are widely scattered, but the SA CIM developers do a great job and documented they work right in the data models. 
In addition, the apparently confusing logic of the CIM makes it hard to find a clear way to find all the relevant field mappings. The funny story is that CIM tries to normalize the Information and itself is full of redundancies und and double field names with different meanings. Of course, there is a leeway between being precise and a global view. This tool can help you balancing on the line.

The CIM Buddy shows you which fields are relevant while you develop a TA with CIM compatibility and present the result of your development. You can examine if your fields are mapped correctly, if tagging works or what the SA CIM searches write into the data model.

The collaboration allows security teams to identify newly created malware that is being used in cybercrime communities before it is seen by any cybersecurity controls. Equipped with the capability to detect malware, viruses, malicious payload in the wild, hackers’ methods, techniques to infiltrate, infect and exfiltrate, the collaboration allows security teams to detect an attack before it impacts their environment. Organization can take identified malwares in the wild, their behavioral pattern, and apply on EDR, XDR, NDR, perimeter security controls to proactively defend against unseen threats.

CYFIRMA DeCYFIR App for Splunk gives security leaders the much-needed control to get ahead of cybercriminals. Based on analysis of threat indicators collected from the deep web, dark web, hacker forums and other closed communities, as well as CYFIRMA’s own research, attacks can be predicted using probability prediction models and analytics engines. By providing threat intelligence from the outside, CYFIRMA can share early warning information when signs of cyber-attacks are detected, enabling cyber teams to take rapid action to thwart attempts at intellectual property theft, ransomware attacks, and other malicious activities. With UI App for Splunk, security operations team are equipped to search for malware, campaigns, threat actors and more, and create their personalized dashboards.

By integrating configurable alert data from Forescout eyeInspect (previously named SilentDefense) with device information and other relevant network activity, this App provides Splunk users with unparalleled contextual information required to identify threats, manage remediation workflows and secure their ICS environment.  

The Forescout OT NSM App for Splunk is the ideal solution for industrial asset owners who want to integrate rich OT asset intelligence and threat detection data from across all OT sites within Splunk. Users can leverage the exceptional OT asset and threat data from Forescout eyeInspect to increase compliance and defend their OT/ICS networks from both operational failures and cyberattacks, such as Ripple 20, EKANS, WannaCry, NotPetya, TRITON and many more. 
 
The Forescout OT NSM App for Splunk contains three pre-built Splunk Dashboards:
- The Security Dashboard helps the user to identify alert trends and correlate them with other network activity, enabling a faster detection of anomalies, cyber threats, dangerous commands sent to OT devices and device misbehavior. It allows to reduce Mean Time to Response by providing the context needed to determine the best mitigation action
- The Asset Inventory Dashboard  lets analysts access high-value device information and context to better identify unexpected changes in the network, prioritize investigations, and quickly acknowledge new assets, communication patterns, or protocols seen within the network to help asset inventory and maintenance processes.
- The Administrative Dashboard provides deep insights on system health status and user activity performed on the Forescout eyeInspect appliances, to prevent system failure and detect undesired user activity.

The Forescout OT NSM App for Splunk automatically maps data to the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) and the Splunk OT Asset Model.

The Multi-cloud Cost Management for Splunk App is designed to give insights into your spending across cloud services. It allows you to see which services are costing money unnecessarily in an attempt to make recommendations as where to make a reduction in spending throughout your Cloud Environments. The current cloud services that are supported are Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure, and Google Cloud.

This app provides a set of dashboards and saved searches to help to give insights into where savings could be found within your cross-cloud infrastructure without reducing the performance.

This app retrieves up to date costing from AWS, Azure and GCP using API calls to give accurate cost saving estimates based on recommendations regarding changes to your Cloud Infrastructure.

GBP and USD conversion is support across all cost estimations and summations. Conversion rates are onboarded hourly by default. Default values are also configurable. Fuctionality is also set to change the conversion rate on the fly.

Dashboards:
General Spending Overview - Shows historic spending trending

VM Instances - Shows data regarding unused VM's and what component of this VM is costing money

VM Utilization - Shows system utilization statistics suggesting which VM's should be investigated for downsizing

Volumes - Summarizes data surrounding unattached volumes and the accumulated cost of these

Elastic IPs - Displays information regarding both unused and unattached public ip addresses that cost money through reservation charges",false,"Apto Solutions","apto_support@aptosolutions.co.uk",false,1116,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/06c3c024-3e79-11ed-8cd7-aa5da4d43c56.png",4602,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2019-07-19T16:35:56.180643Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_"""",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[______""""_","IT Operations

akamai:json_metrics -> collect Prolexic metrics using Prolexic API docs

All data is logged as JSON objects. The ingestion is performed once for every run of the input but for only new or updated metrics. For each metric the input keeps track of the last epoch timestamp logged for each metric-contract/subnet and only the recents events are logged to avoid duplicates.

akamai:json_conf -> collects GTM and DNS zones using Akamai GTM and DNS API

All data is logged as JSON objects. The ingestion is performed once for every run of the input.

akamai:json_event -> collects Prolexic events using Prolexic API.

All data is logged as JSON objects. The ingestion is performed once for every run of the input but for only new or updated events. The input calculate and saves and hash for each events (using the helper checkpoint functions from Splunk or by falling back to a local file). Only events with new hashes are logged to avoid duplicates.

akamai:json_siem collects SIEM API events.

All data is logged as JSON objects. The ingestion is performed as long as the API return at least on event or the desidered time limit is reached. The input saves the offset provided by the API so in the next run it will start to collect new events (more details in the API docs). This is the input that usually is collecting a lot of data, be careful.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
CCX Security Operations has taken it upon ourselves to update and improve the existing Firepower Syslog and Cisco Secure eStreamer Client (f.k.a Firepower eNcore) Add-On for Splunk as to ensure it is as CIM compliant as possible.
This TA was built using a large dataset and endeavours to be the most CIM compliant comprehensive field extraction TA available for Cisco Firepower eStreamer and Firepower Syslog.
The Technical Addon replaces the publicly available TA on Search Heads and Indexers, and it is based on the latest version.

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

Features:
- This TA currently supports logtypes tagged under the following CIM datamodels: Alert, Malware, Web, Network Traffic, Network Resolution (DNS), and Intrusion Detection (IDS).

The Splunk GUI for SysStat provides visualization of the system activity collected with the SysStat package. This includes I/O transfer rates, paging activity, process-related activities, interrupts, network activity, memory and swap space utilization, CPU utilization among others. The statistics can be collected in near real-time from as many hosts as you like (potentially thousands). The SysStat package is already present in all major Linux distributions and likely already installed, is a non-intrusive, secure and lightweight way to collect system activity information.

Imagine being able to see output of vmstat, sar or iostat for any period in the past!

A unique feature of the app is the ability to show any available parameters of your choice in one graph.

It is suitable for an ad-hoc or permanent advanced performance troubleshooting and profiling. 

The analysis of historical performance data and the detection of bottlenecks allows the establishment of a baseline of the resource usage, predicts utilization and reduces costs, especially in cloud environment like AWS.

The advanced logging app for Cisco WSA redefines monitoring and troubleshooting by aggregating diverse logs from Cisco WSA devices. A standout feature is its unparalleled ability to parse and visualize the typically concealed prox_track log, unconfigurable through the GUI. Positioned as both a replacement for and a valuable addition to traditional SNMP-based monitoring, this app excels across various crucial areas:

Overview:
Comprehensive display of all WSA proxies with current and peak values. Metrics include requests per second, CPU/RAM/Disk load, and server/client connections.
Timings and Load Values:
In-depth insights into various timings and load values for Authentication, DNS, and other essential modules.
Comparative Analysis:
Unique functionality to not only display values but also facilitate the comparison of metrics between different systems.
Internal Visibility:
Leveraging track_stats/prox_track.log, the app provides a profound view into the internal workings of WSA.
Correlation Graphs:
Build correlation graphs illustrating the relationship between requests per second and system load, enabling the identification of potential bottlenecks.
Audit View:
A dedicated audit view to track user logins and monitor system changes, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of system activity.

Using this app you can configure a number of AWS accounts with ease and a pre-build dashboard displays your Trusted Advisor recommendations in one place, for all accounts, with the option of breaking down per account. 

More information and documentation can be found at: https://github.com/livehybrid/TA-aws-trusted-advisor

AWS accounts can be configured using AWS Access/Secret keys or can be left blank to use the instance profile if running on AWS, along with an option to AssumeRole to a relevant role with permissions. This easily allows your Splunk instance to assume a role in other accounts for the purpose of data collection relating to AWS Trusted Advisor.

Please respect people's privacy and adhere to the service's acceptable use (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#AcceptableUse). I tried respecting the limits posed on the API's use in the command's source code, which is why you'll have to have a little patience when querying for large amounts of mail addresses.

I was unsatisfied with the publicly available Splunk add-ons already providing this functionality as they either didn't allow control over what and how is queried for or didn't format the output to my wishes. So I came up with my own Splunk add-on implementing these missing features.

Cross-compatible with Python 2 and 3. Tested on Splunk Enterprise 9.0.2 and 8.2.3 on Windows, Linux and Splunk Cloud.

Splunk Synthetics Monitoring is a platform to synthetically measure performance of your web based properties. This supporting add-on for Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise demonstrates the value of bringing this synthetic data into the Splunk platform for use in regular SPL queries as well as into Splunk ITSI searches that populate KPIs and Events.

This supporting add-on creates a new command in your Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) called `synthetics` that will bring your synthetics data into Splunk directly from your Splunk Synthetic Monitoring environment. This new `synthetics` command has a set of subcommands to retrieve the right data, and the results can be further processed using your SPL skills. You can create a correlated view that includes data from your Splunk Synthetics Monitoring platform alongside whatever you have in Splunk, including your Log and Observability data.

This add-on also enables you to use the Content Pack for Splunk Synthetic Monitoring within Splunk ITSI, which provides out of the box KPIs, Entities and Services in order to integrate your synthetic metrics into the overall Service view in Splunk ITSI. More information about this Content Pack is here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ITSICP/current/Config/AboutSM

Code42 integrates with Splunk to deliver valuable file exfiltration events to custom dashboards for correlation and triage within the Splunk Security Operations Suite.

Code42’s insider risk detection lenses surface insights for subsets of users more likely to put data at risk, such as users with access to proprietary information or departing employees. Extracting this data into dashboards within Splunk provides actionable insights that can be applied to existing SOC workflows to substantiate insider threat investigations and speed response.

Generating Commands
KV Store Backup: Backup KV Store collections to the file system on the search head.
KV Store Restore: Restore KV Store collections from backup jobs*. Lists all existing backups in the default path if no arguments are given.
KV Store Push: Copy KV Store collections from the local Splunk search head to a remote instance or comma-separated instance list (SH/SHC)*.
KV Store Pull: Copy KV Store collections from a remote Splunk search head (SH/SHC) to the local instance*.
Delete Key: Delete KV Store records from a collection based on user input.

Streaming Commands
Create Foreign Key: Creates an entry in a lookup and appends the resulting _key value to the current search results. Useful for writing linked entries in two lookups.
Delete Keys: Delete KV Store records from a collection based on _key values in search results.

Alert Actions
Send to Collection: Similar to outputlookup, but can be toggled on/off by users that have permissions to edit search jobs without modifying the search. This functionality has been implemented by Splunk directly into the product since this was written.

* Deletes the collections from the target host before writing (unless otherwise specified).

** Notes to SplunkCloud SRE:
- This app must be installed on Enterprise Security searchheads  (NOT IDM), and includes a modinput, which must be allowed to run on the searchhead.  This app will not work on an IDM, indexer, or a search head which does not have Enterprise Security.  
- This app's modinput contains checks to ensure that it will only run on the cluster Captain when installed on an ES SHC.  
- The modinput fetches cyber threat observables from TruSTAR's REST API and posts them to the searchheads' kvstores using the kvstore ""batch_save"" endpoint, not an index as most modinputs do.  This is why it must run on the searchheads, not an IDM.  There is no config option that would allow the user to tell the modinput to post the observables to that endpoint on a different host, it's hard-coded to post to ""localhost"".
- This app is compatible with ES SHC, but its ES SHC compatibility is implemented in a way which requires replicating ""inputs.conf"" from all Splunk apps on the stack to all nodes in the SHC  by setting ""conf_replication_include.inputs = true"" in ""server.conf"".   This is standard for all Splunk apps created using Splunk's Addon Builder.  If this behavior is problematic for other Splunk apps on the user's SHC, user will need to decide which app they prefer to use:  TruSTAR Unified or the app with which that conflicts.  See SINT-3685 for more details / information. 
- The app contains modactions that need to be available on all ES SHC nodes, so the app needs to be installed on all SHC nodes.

This app provides two JSON-specific search commands to reduce your search and development efforts:

* jmespath - Precision query tool for JSON events or fields
* jsonformat - Format, validate, and order JSON content

In some cases, a single jmsepath call can replace a half-dozen built-in search commands.  Sound too good to be true?  The jmespath command can parse nested JSON strings and unroll arrays {Name: x, Value: y} hashes with ease.  Checkout the examples and try it yourself!

NOTE:  The 1.0.x series is stable and the 1.9.x release are in preparation for 2.0.0. Some backwards compatibility changes are planned and several things aren't yet set in stone.  Contact us if you have any concerns or would like to be involved.

The app detects seasonal patterns and finds anomalies in just a couple of clicks.


Using the app, you can create anomaly detection jobs, run these jobs on a regular cadence, view SPL queries, and create alerts. The app works with any time series dataset that can be ingested into the Splunk platform, provided the points in the time series are evenly spaced.


The app uses machine learning to detect seasonality in the data without user inputs, lowering the barriers to realizing value. The app also performs health diagnostics on the time series to check whether the dataset is suitable for anomaly detection using our algorithm. If the dataset is not fit for anomaly detection with our algorithm, we have included steps to preprocess the data in the docs. (We are working on supporting more time series out of the box without preprocessing steps for the next version).


When you create an anomaly detection job, the app generates an SPL query you can view and use elsewhere within Splunk.


Similar to other Splunk applications, the resource consumption of CPU and memory is commensurate with the size of the datasets that you use.

The Splunk AI Assistant (preview) empowers users to search their data using plain English. Now you can write a prompt of what you want in plain English, and Splunk AI Assistant translates the request into query ideas that you can execute or build on, all within a familiar Splunk interface. Splunk AI Assistant also explains what a given SPL query is doing in plain English with a summary as well as a detailed breakdown of the query. 

Under the hood, the Splunk AI Assistant uses generative AI to lower the barrier to using SPL. It provides a chat experience which is intuitive and simple. For new users, it reduces the learning curve for using SPL. Advanced users will find the assistant helpful in unlocking the power of SPL and understanding complex SPL queries.

Please note that:
- The app collects data that can be used to fine tune the model
- Please do not enter any data that is personally identifiable, confidential or otherwise sensitive
- The preview app should not be installed in any compliance environment.

The app is supported by the development team which can be reached at mlsupport@splunk.com. 

Because this app is in Preview, users will need to download the app from Splunk's Preview portal to sign up.

**Our team recently discovered security vulnerabilities in this app that have been fixed in version 2.2.0.**

# What You Need to Know #
We discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in the AppInspect App for Splunk, which affects the upload endpoint in the application. This could essentially allow attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands. Additionally, a SSRF vulnerability was found. In order to take advantage of these vulnerabilities, the user would need to have successfully authenticated to the Splunk instance. 

Both of these issues have been resolved.

Please note that this affects **all versions** of the AppInspect App for Splunk app **prior to version 2.2.0**.

# Recommended Course of Action #
If you have the app installed on any non-local machines, it is recommended to remove or update the AppInspect App for Splunk as soon as possible.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Why an app for AppInspect? (So Meta) #
An easy way to send your Splunk Apps to AppInspect's API.

# Who is this app for? #
- Anyone who builds Splunk apps. The goal is to make the process easier as well as making sure you are always validating
your app against the newest version of AppInspect.

# How does the app work? #
- This app works with the https://api.splunk.com REST API
- Your .tar.gz or .tgz file will be uploaded into this app's local directory and then removed once it has been
sent to AppInspect for validation.
- Only the most recently generated AppInspect report is kept on disk. A copy of this is located in the
app's local/reports/ directory

# Steps to use: #
1. Login using your Splunk credentials
2. Click or drag and drop on the file drop area (must be a tar.gz/.tgz)
3. Modify settings to fit your specific needs
4. Wait for results

A fundamental tenet of BitSight’s SPM solution is the ability to contextualize an organization’s cybersecurity performance over time. Leveraging meaningful metrics that are independently verified to correlate to breach risk, this view of “performance over time” ultimately guides the organization in its effort to reduce cyber risk to achieve desired business outcomes. The advanced security performance analytics facilitate a universal understanding of the organization’s cyber risk aiding business leaders and board members delivery of effective cybersecurity program oversight for the organization. 
Security leaders and their teams rely on BitSight SPM to:
     - Continuously monitor the effectiveness of security controls
     - Facilitate uniform performance targets across the organization
     - Provide in-depth comparisons of the organization’s cybersecurity performance against peers
     - Streamline program management decisions, including the ongoing remediation of security controls
     - Communicate program performance to non-technical stakeholders using meaningful context

Bring BitSight SPM into your security program through this integration with Splunk.

Features:
1. Cover all standard necessary fields in Atlassian Jira for issue creation such as Project, Summary, Issue Type, Priority, Description, Assignee, Labels, Components.
2. Add the result of Splunk Alert into the Jira issue at the end of the description field. There are two possible views of added data
    1) The table view where the table head consists of Splunk Alert result fields
    2) The list view when the result of Splunk alert will be added as a Jira code snippet.   
3. Possibility to use one additional custom field to create Jira issues. 
4. Control what information from Splunk Alert will appear in Jira issues. Pass search result values dynamically into Jira issues.
Not necessary to use a digital ID of values in the Jira field. All fields take human-readable values. 
Sample: you have a Jira project with the short name “CORP” with id=2331. In the configuration of Splunk Alert, you don’t need to use the Id of Jira Project. You need to use the name of Project “CORP”.  Atlassian JIRA Issue Alerts add-on will automatically convert human-readable values into digital Id.

The basic idea is to first encrypt data within an event and produce a new file with the same content as before, but with the data matching group(1) in a regular expression encrypted and saved on disk using base64. The next thing to do is index the newly required file into Splunk with a sourcetype.

At search time, you will then be able to decrypt the data. Read the README.txt for installation and usage. Two experimental dashboards have been added for Splunk 6+ that you can use in your own app to control access to decrypt.

The exported file is just a gzipped CSV of the search results that triggered the alert.

The real intent of this add-on though is as an example for developers to follow to show how you can essentially leverage the Modular Alerts framework to perform a scheduled data output.

Other types of outputs to consider implementing : ftp,scp,jms,kafka,aws,rdbms,datawarehouse,some other data storage or processing platform etc...

The Python code in this App is dual 2.7/3 compatible.
This version of the App enforces Python 3 for execution of the modular alert script when running on Splunk 8+ in order to satisfy Splunkbase AppInspect requirements.
If running this App on Splunk versions prior to 8 , then Python 2.7 will get executed.

Content Manager App  is a Splunk application designed to assist administrators in efficiently managing Splunk configurations and handling the intricacies of complex multi Splunk Cloud stacks platforms through automation streamlining their tasks and enhancing overall efficiency.

#Requirements :
Using Content Manager App require having access to the the  API REST endpoint  of your Splunk Cloud Stacks.
You can use ACS features to update your API white list and add ip address of the current management splunk node.

For more information about  ACS and IP Allow List, please visit: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/9.1.2308/Config/ConfigureIPAllowList


#Features :
This Application contains  four  main features:

-  Manage Servers :  This feature facilitates the management of Splunk Cloud stacks. Add, modify, delete stacks or categorize them under different groups.  The only prerequisite is to have a valid authentication token to be able to initiate communications with the Splunk Cloud Stack.  
    
-  Manage Content: In this view, the user will have the flexibility to choose Splunk configurations or full applications and then select one of the predefined actions to process them.  This will offer an automated method to perform multiple actions on multiple apps/configurations and deploy them to multiple stacks.  
The user will be guided in a user friendly wizard to select content and targets, review all that and then  **deploy or schedule**  the deployment job.

- Check and Compare stack's Content : This feature enables administrators to list all installed applications on Splunk Cloud stacks, verifying their versions and detecting any newer releases for Splunkbase apps.  The compare mode activates when more than one stack is selected, displaying common applications (to verify if an app is installed on all selected stacks) and ensuring version consistency across all selected stacks.

- Manage Workflows:  A workflow represents a predefined set of actions that users/Admins can create and customize. Users have the option to craft new workflows by selecting actions from a library of predefined ones:  
    * Deploy:  deploy packages or configurations to splunk cloud stack(s)  
    * Inspect:  Inspect packages with AppInspect  
    * Save to disk:  Save generated packages to disk  
    * Push:  push to a CI/CD Pipeline.",false,"Atef Kouki","akouki_splunk",true,201,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/c1720786-02d2-11ef-916c-322dcf8115ca.png",7062,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,sgt,"Splunk General Terms","https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",sgt,"https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",71,"",splunk,"enterprise

This add on is now deprecated, in favour of https://apps.splunk.com/app/7089/ ""Splunk Add-on for Electricity Carbon Intensity"", which expands the number of National Grid Carbon Intensity APIs supported, and adds Electricity Maps as a source.

=========================

National Grid Carbon Intensity Add-on for Splunk enables the retrieval and indexing of data from National Grid’s Carbon Intensity API.

This API provides an indicative trend of regional carbon intensity of the electricity system in Great Britain (GB) 96+ hours ahead of real-time, in addition to current and historic data.

With accurate current carbon intensity for energy used (rather than high level conversion factors, often updated on an annual basis), organisations can have realtime indications on how they are tracking their progress towards reduction goals.

With carbon intensity forecast data, organisations can adjust the planned schedule of electricity intensive activities to minimize their carbon footprint.

Dashboards to analyse the returned data are provided in the Sustainability Toolkit for Splunk - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6343/.

Setup:
See the Details tab for dependencies and setup instructions.
 
Privacy:
This app does not require PII nor does it send any data outside the Splunk environment.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Extensions for Airlock Digital Add-on look to provide field extraction and CIM compliance for Airlock Digital log sources captured via the Add-on Airlock Digital or via HTTP Event Collector (HEC).

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Airlock Digital Add-On (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5674) but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

This add-on provides field extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes ""airlock:svractivities"" and ""airlock:exechistories"".

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

With CyCognito’s attacker’s perspective combined with features like Splunk’s Risk-Based Alerting, security teams can detect and react to more threats while drastically reducing the number of false positives they experience.

Integrating asset and vulnerability data from CyCognito into Splunk automatically sends the highest risk issues to the Splunk SIEM. Dashboards provide security teams across the organization visibility into external risks they may not have otherwise known existed. Security Operations teams can easily be alerted to these new threats – complete with step-by-step exploitation instructions to validate risk, safe sandbox to simulate attacks, and indicators of compromise (IOCs) – and use integrated features to decrease your MTTR, ensuring your enterprise is protected from future attacks.",false,"CyCognito Integrations Team","splunk-integration-team@cycognito.com",false,238,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/6e694a7c-f1a2-11ee-b1c6-e65ed34d4dee.png",6599,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",71,"",splunk,"enterprise

- You use Splunk Enterprise to **collect and centralize your production or security logs** and you would like to have a system to monitor all these logs in order to identify specific elements (called artifacts).
- These artefacts may represent a threat to your business and **you want your security teams to be able to detect those artifacts** and remediate any incident linked to them.
- In addition, **you want to make the time spent by your analysts on the detections found in your logs profitable**. If your analysts have spent several hours identifying an alert as a false positive, you would like to be able to ""qualify"" the alert so that the next time an event matching this qualification (or signature) is detected, a different automated treatment is performed (such as not being alerted if it was considered a false positive by your teams)

Technically speaking, this TA allows you to :
- Easily set a monitoring on specific artifacts (IP, URL, Mails, Hash, Username etc.) stored in KV stores and be alerted when one of your event match at least one artifact thanks to the Splunk automatic lookups
- You can organize your artifacts through cases, also stored in KVStores, to link them and attach them a tag to have a specific process in case of a detection
- For every detection, you can choose the way you want to centralize your alerts and select a qualification for a specific signature (which relies on event types in Splunk)
- You can customize your qualifications/signatures in order to have specific process (for example, receive an alert in case of a NEW alert and not be alerted when the alert is qualified as FALSE POSITIVE), this is done by having saved searches on which you can customize the actions when The Watch events are detected.

The main concept of this tool is to identify events from known information (IP, URL or any other field extracted by Splunk) without having to create a new search for each artefact, without necessarily knowing which sources are analysed but also to capitalise on the time spent on our investigations.",false,"Alexandre Demeyer",letmer00t,false,262,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/0c8ccd10-40d2-11ed-be44-f21d8487e317.png",6611,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,mit,"MIT License","https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",mit,"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2022-10-03T16:43:03.557191Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_""-"",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[______""""","SIEM

Threat analysts can determine what data is sent automatically to Splunk reference tables through the bi-directional app. This integration gives Splunk operators a view of the whole chain of threat activity. Going the other direction, the app can automatically send sightings from Splunk to EclecticIQ Intelligence Center for dissemination and analyst review.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
CCX Security Operations has taken it upon ourselves to improve the existing Splunk Add-ons ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add On"" and ""Proofpoint TAP Modular Input"" as to ensure it is as CIM compliant as possible.

This TA does not replace the public Splunk Add-ons for ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add On"" and ""Proofpoint TAP Modular Input"", but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently, this add-on provides additional field extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes:

- pps_messagelog (Proofpoint On Demand Email Security)
- proofpoint_tap_siem (Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection - TAP)
- ccx:proofpoint:trap:hec (Proofpoint Threat Response Auto-Pull - TRAP)

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

Features:

To enable rule streaming, configure Jobs in the Continuous Content Management (CCM) module of the SOC Prime Platform and specify them in the App's data input. Jobs are configured with Content Lists to select rules for deployment, Presets to automatically modify the rules' parameters, and Filters to include additional conditions. You can also set up and apply Custom Field Mapping profiles to make the names of indexes, fields, and even field values in the rule code match your custom data schema.  

To obtain rules via the CCM module and stream them into your environment, you need access to the SOC Prime CCM API. For more details on the API, see our Platform Guides: https://help.socprime.com/en/articles/6265791-api (to open the Guides, you need to be logged in to your SOC Prime Platform account).

The UiPath Robotic Process Monitoring (RPM) for Splunk is an application for monitoring UiPath RPA deployments.  The App provides a quick setup, and out of the box visibility into your RPA reliability, performance, and security.  You can also calculate ROI metrics for time saved and dollars saved for any Process Automation.  The App also includes a full bi-directional integration with the UiPath API through Splunk Alert Actions.  This gives full data loop feedback directly in real-time to restart Robots, restart stalled jobs, or event kick off other Automations in UiPath. 
 
Setup:

See the Details tab for dependencies and setup instructions.  Configuring data collection is only a two step process: 

1. UiPath Webhooks pushing events to Splunk HEC for Job, Queue, Robot, Process events
2. Splunk Universal Forwarder running on UiPath Orchestrator for collecting UiPath Execution logs

Privacy:

RPA technologies automate business process that touch many systems and API's.  RPA configurations may include in their execution logs process names, systems accessed, credentials used, etc.  Splunk has many configurations that can mask or obfuscate data fields in flight, at rest, or in search.  Please reference this documentation if you have these concerns. https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Data/Anonymizedata

pinpointing outstanding data needs, all while dynamically updating the validation criteria as your environment evolves.

Embark on a simplified data management journey with the DataSense Navigator, a tool designed to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights within the Splunk environment. Traditionally, the journey from data onboarding to use case development is often disjointed. This fragmentation can lead to overlooked use case considerations, necessitating time-consuming adjustments later on.  DataSense Navigator integrates the analysis of use case and data preparation requirements right from the start, reducing delays and avoiding the hassle of rework.

The DataSense Navigator addresses the industry's evolving needs by offering a streamlined, data-centric approach that automates the identification of use case field and data model requirements, enhancing efficiency and accuracy significantly. It tackles various scenarios including:

•	Efficient Use Case Discovery: Speeds up the identification and recommendation of use cases based on existing data quality, aiding in future planning, especially when partial prerequisites are met.
•	Data Quality Validation: Conducts a thorough examination of event presence within vital data models for ES use cases, offering a clear insight into data quality.
•	Priority Setting for Data Quality Improvement: Pinpoints gaps in field extractions or configurations, aiding in precise effort planning and prioritization of data quality improvement tasks.
•	Post-Configuration Push Impact Analysis: Assesses the effect of configuration changes on use case coverage, helping to identify success or the need for further adjustments.
•	Structured Workflow Facilitation: Accommodates varying expertise levels with its structured yet interactive workflow design, guiding users to insightful conclusions regarding data and use case gaps.

One distinguishing feature is its Event-Specific Subsampling Techniques, which moves away from the traditional approach of analyzing large data sets in aggregate, to examining each event on an individual basis. This feature, along with minimal configuration, automatic adaptation to all data models, and an integrated user-friendly workflow, not only addresses the identified problems but also serves as an educational tool, illuminating each stage of the analysis process.

The current landscape of data onboarding and use case enablement faces scalability challenges leading to time-consuming processes, with existing tools falling short in unifying use case quality assessment and development. The DataSense Navigator emerges as a solution in this scenario, easing the transition to a more accessible, efficient, and insightful Splunk experience.

This TA represents a collection of diverse Splunk visualizations packed all into one app. The advantage of this is the ease of installation and management of all visualizations through one TA.
The Repository contains all Data in . The installed versions of the visualizations are listed in the Details tab.
Install this TA on all Search Heads you want to use with more than the standard Visualizations.

Visualizations make it easier to analyze and interact with data during investigations or within dashboards and reports.
The right visual goes a long way to understanding the results of the analysis of your most complex data.
With rich visualization you can easily find the right diagram to make your results known across your organization—in the boardroom or in the war room.
Splunkbase contains a wide array of Splunk-built visuals, and a development framework that makes it simple for customers and partners to create new visuals and make them available to the community.

Questions they must answer include: ​

What devices are impacted? ​
Where are the devices located? ​
Who's using those devices? ​
What OS and software are the devices running? ​
Is there a software vulnerability on the device? ​
What information is contained on the device, and is it sensitive or confidential information? ​

Knowing the answers to these questions helps to pinpoint the threat and its potential impact, and prioritize the next actions. Alerts don't typically come with this information, however, even though all of it is essential for accelerating response time and stopping an attack. While teams spend time hunting down IT asset data, the attack could be spreading rapidly, causing massive damage. Threat investigations and responses are performed faster and at scale across complex or expansive IT infrastructures when IT asset enrichment data is instantly available within the SOAR solution.

This Splunk app integrates with Lansweeper to perform investigative actions:

1.test connectivity: Validate the asset configuration for connectivity using supplied configuration
2.list authorized sites: Retrieve authorized sites from Lansweeper with their ID(s) and names
3.hunt ip: Fetch the details of the asset from the Lansweeper platform for the given site ID and IP address
4.hunt mac: Fetch the details of the asset from the Lansweeper platform for the given site ID and MAC address

(Ok well you can - anyone who’s ever used their lips as a high-pressure air nozzle for a Nintendo cartridge or shaken the computer a few times and it started behaving may disagree - but I assert this is blind luck and don’t condone proactive violence)

With Splunk dashboards - and especially complex Splunk dashboards - keeping track of tokens can be a nightmare. Your end users may not be super-tech-savvy. They may have NO idea what’s going on with Splunk under the covers.

Introducing the Dashboard Helpdesk. Dashboard Helpdesk gives Splunk Admins (and any other level that provide troubleshooting) the ability to see the holistic user experience at the time they experienced the issue.

User account info? ✅
State of the Splunk environment? ✅
All installed apps? ✅
User environment? ✅
SCREENSHOT OF THE DASHBOARD? ✅
TOKENS? ✅

…wait. which tokens?

All of them. The form tokens. The dashboard tokens. The default token model. The submitted token model.

AND, with some of the parameters, you can see in real-time (yes, real REAL time, not near-time or “real” time) a comparison of the current state of the parameters versus the state when the person submitted the issue report.

Compatible with Splunk versions from 7.2 to 9.0, and in Splunk Cloud and Enterprise, enabling this functionality requires only installing the Dashboard Helpdesk app.

The only (for now) configurable bit is the index in which you’d like to story the issue report.

Download or install the Dashboard Helpdesk today from Splunkbase to (don’t use the cliche supercharge, Paul) to wormhole qualifying issues your end users have from 5-6 hops to 0. With only 4 lines of code on any #SimpleXML dashboard, Dashboard Helpdesk starts working its magic.

Bring the ultimate observability to your Splunk dashboards!

The process of implementing these configurations to a system can be complex and extraordinarily time consuming. In addition to remediating STIGs on all system components, you must be able to effectively report on and continuously monitor the compliance posture of your systems as they evolve over time. In a lot of cases, this process is managed with Excel spreadsheets and other tools that don’t allow you to get real insights into the data being captured in your compliance body of evidence. Worse yet, the manual nature of completing this work can be time consuming and very prone to human error.

KGI’s Atlas platform includes the STIG Compliance Application that is designed to assist with the entire process of putting systems into a compliant state, managing the compliance body of evidence, and reporting on the state of your system STIG compliance. This is accomplished by bringing your compliance data into the Atlas STIG Compliance App from your STIG checklists and vulnerability scanning systems. The Atlas STIG Compliance solution also includes an integration with Puppet that is capable of putting your RedHat systems into a compliant state and then sending real-time data about the current state of your systems over to Splunk. The makes the Atlas STIG Compliance a comprehensive solution that encompasses STIG Compliance reporting and remediation.

Key Features of Atlas STIG Compliance:
- Create and define systems that represent your environment or your accreditation boundaries.
- Visualize your compliance status at a system and system component level to better understand the quality of your systems.
- Automatically Ingests any STIG or SRG Checklist into Splunk.
- Track STIG Compliance posture over time to build an audit trail of your compliance activities.
- Easily update comments, finding details, status and more for your STIG Checklists within Splunk.
- Save time by bulk editing all of checklists at one time from the Splunk UI.
- Export your STIG Checklists from Splunk in the .ckl format so that they can be opened in the DISA STIG Viewer or imported into external systems.
- Allow teams to collaborate on STIG Compliance activities inside of the Splunk UI.
- Quickly audit your STIG checklists to identify checklists that have missing comments or finding details in your compliance body of evidence.
- Automatically identify discrepancies between your STIG Checklists and your vulnerability scans (SCAP and ACAS).
- Create custom POA&M reports that can be exported from Splunk.
- DISA STIG Templates are included in the App and are visible in the STIG Library feature

The Avaya Call Analytics Splunk App is part of a solution called CallAnalytics which captures CTI events from Avaya AES and provides real time reports and analytics for call center users. For detail information of CallAnalytics, please visit  https://blog.upinget.com/2017/04/30/call-analytics/ . 

The CallAnalytics has a server module which is installed in your data center, it captures a lot of data from CTI and sends the data to your Splunk instance which can be installed on premise or on cloud. The useful information including real time and historical data of monitoring objects such as Queue, VDN, Trunk and Agent. The CallAnalytics solution supports the following features:
- To detect nuisance call attacks by monitoring abandon calls and short duration calls
- To detect fraud activities such as KPI manipulation which caused by agent short duration calls
- To identify the callers of the abandon and short duration calls
- To capture user data from TSAPI UUI and store the user data together with the call data in Splunk 
- To provide real time data for building of real time reports and dashboards
- To trace a call from its beginning to the end, multiple call records can be correlated by common key such as UCID
- To list customers waiting in queue together with their calling number and waiting time
- To find out how long each customer waits for an agent
- To find out the frequency and duration of an agent to perform hold call
- To find out agent or customer who hangups a call first

In order to capture the CTI events and send them to Splunk, you need a CallAnalytics license key. Please contact service@upinget.com for a permanent license or trial. The Avaya Call Analytics Splunk App is FREE!

Organizations moving to the cloud are vulnerable to unplanned events such as data loss, outages, user error and malicious attacks. While AWS is responsible for securing the cloud infrastructure, it is the customers’ responsibility to protect the data and applications that are running in AWS. They are also challenged with managing large volumes of data and likely to be using multiple applications to manage and monitor their cloud environment. This presents a visibility problem, where it becomes difficult and time-consuming to monitor key operations such as backup and recovery, leading to reactive decision-making and potential downtime which could be catastrophic.

Solution:
N2WS and Splunk address this problem through an integrated solution that delivers real-time monitoring of backup, recovery and disaster recovery operations to help organizations respond quickly and make informed, data-driven decisions. With the N2WS app for Splunk, IT teams gain a holistic view of their AWS environment, which lets them leverage key data points relating to backup, DR and data lifecycle performance, and be alerted to potential issues.

N2WS app for Splunk:
The N2WS app for Splunk provides joint customers with a customizable dashboard to monitor, analyze and action data as it flows in from the N2WS console. Teams using N2WS and Splunk will benefit from a unified view of their AWS environment to improve business resilience. 
Teams using N2WS and Splunk benefit from a unified view of their AWS environment to minimize downtime and maintain business continuity.

Beyond Identity’s integration with Splunk feeds real-time data about the users and devices attempting to access your critical cloud resources across applications. When Splunk is integrated with Beyond Identity, security teams can ensure only secured devices and authorized users access company data. This stops all password-based attacks and definitively blocks lateral movement, feeding real-time risk signals into Splunk Enterprise Security to help improve threat detection and incident response.  
 
Beyond Identity continuously gathers data concerning the security posture of registered devices and forces their adherence to organizational device security policies.  Real-time risk-based authentication is informed by dozens of user and device risk signals during each login - enabling customers to enforce continuous, dynamic access control across the cloud applications and resources used to operate your organization. 


When Splunk is integrated with Beyond Identity, security teams get:

Strong Authentication Beyond Identity eliminates passwords as an authentication method and cryptographically binds user identity to the device via the secure TPM hardware on the device. This eliminates credential-based attacks and provides a very high assurance of the user identity before allowing access to critical SaaS resources. 

Granular Risk Signals and Immutable Logs Beyond Identity  captures granular device security posture data at the exact time of login such as operating system version,  security software state, and device type. Authentication event data is captured and aggregated in the Beyond Identity Administrative Portal for every login attempt. 

Identify Risky Users Beyond Identity stops unauthorized users and rejects devices from authentication if they do not meet an organization’s security requirements. Unauthorized devices that are not bound to a valid identity are stopped from authenticating. All authentication data is fed into Splunk and normalized to inform threat detection defense                                                                                                  

Event Mapping to CIM Beyond Identity injects data from every authentication attempt into Splunk’s Common Information Model to extract insights about the security posture of device-bound users, their authentication attempts, and the rejection of those who failed to satisfy device security requirements.

What is/are infotools you ask???

This app is a collection of custom commands that let you see information from the search head that may normally require access to a command shell or file system.

In version 1.1.1 there are 11 custom commands:

| lookupinfo - see the location size and modtime of lookups

| bundleinfo - see what inside the latest search bundle

| userinfo - lists all files in the etc/users directory with size and modtime

| appinfo - lists all files in the etc/app directory with size and modtime

| btoolinfo - yet another btool output (blocked in Splunk Cloud)

| artifactinfo - view or search the info.csv file in search artifacts

| pinginfo - run a ping from your search head to measure latency or availability

| sslinfo - run the openssl s_client to view certificate details

| varinfo - see the size and modtimes of files in the splunk/var directory

| cliinfo - run the splunk cli commands: status, list, show, display, help (blocked in Splunk Cloud)

| specinfo - view the details of the .conf.spec files

Each of these commands is a generating command (must be first command in the pipeline) and return results about the file objects.

What is the use case for infotools?

Glad you asked...

In Splunk Cloud and with many on-premise deployments most users do not have access to the file system.
It can be very useful to be able to see details about some specific Splunk files to help with troubleshooting.

For example:

One of the most common problems in many environments is large lookups file affecting bundle replication
the restapi commands for lookups do not return information about the file size if the lookup is not defined in transforms.conf, so you need access to the file system to see this information

In a search head cluster, large lookups that are frequently updated can impact performance since the entire file is replicated to all members
since lookupinfo provides the modtime, you can see if a lookup has been recently updated",false,"Splunk Works",splunklabs,true,425,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/579c4d68-5bab-11ee-8fe6-16bdc55339b1.png",6308,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,sgt,"Splunk General Terms","https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",sgt,"https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",65,"",splunk,"enterprise

SecurityScorecard is a security ratings platform that enables enterprises to instantly rate and understand the security risk of companies, non-intrusively and from an outside-in perspective. We use an A-F rating scale. Companies with a C, D or F rating are 5.4 times more likely to be breached or face compliance penalties than companies with an A or B rating. Our platform is used by hundreds of customers for use-cases including vendor risk management, cyber insurance, board reporting, and M&A. Headquartered in New York City, we are funded by top investors like Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, NGP, Moody’s, Intel, and others. Our vision is to create a new language for companies and their partners to communicate, understand, and improve each other’s security posture.

Compatible with all cybersecurity solutions, it immediately enhances your detection with contextual information about internal and external cyber threats specifically targeting your business.

Main benefits for user :

INCREASE YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND VISIBILITY OF FUTURE CYBER THREATS
LastInfosec's technology continuously inventories and evaluates data sources accessible through multiple channels: social networks, specialized sites, the darknet and the deep web, to collect indicators of compromise that are enriched and contextualized to your activity, with the objective of reducing the time required to analyze a threat when it is detected

SAVE TIME FOR YOUR SOC ANALYSTS
LastInfoSec makes it easier for your operational security teams to make decisions and drastically reduces their analysis and incident response time without changing their internal processes. The time saved increases the quality of alert coverage.

REDUCE RISK
LastInfoSec has a library of millions of indicators of compromise (IoCs). Its automated collection, analysis, and correlation engines make threat information available an average of 24 hours ahead of the competition with over 5,500 new validated and enhanced markers per day.

REDUCE NOISE AND FALSE POSITIVES
Because our data is enriched and contextualized beforehand, it generates only meaningful alerts and includes all the information needed to understand them. False positives from your solutions or other Threat Intelligence sources are also mitigated by correlation with our CTI feed.


If you need information about the access and Cyber Threat Intelligence feed, you can contact us with https://info.gatewatcher.com/en/fr/lp/splunkbase

The Gatewatcher LastInfoSec CTI Feed App (gwlastinfosec) helps you download, parse and use
LastInfoSec Threat intelligence IOC data feed directly from your Splunk searches.
It helps to visualize the downloaded data with the 3 dashboards:
- GW LastInfoSec - IoC Explore: last IoC table with search (first 50 rows)

Then the data file is daily archived and moved to a directory at a time that defined by you. The program can convert the CDR data into CSV format or import them into database. Since the tool uses ODBC, database such as MySQL, MariaDB and MSSQL are supported. Moreover, the program can send the CDR data to Splunk which enables you to search CDR record by specific field name, generate reports and dashboards very easily.

After installation of the Avaya  CDR Splunk App, please create the index avayacdr and enable HTTP Event Collector for receiving the events from the AvayaCDR server module.

It is a set of pre-configured dashboards that help you glean valuable insights from the Cyara data. By enabling you to trend Cyara Pulse CX monitoring results over time (both short-term and long-term), these dashboards provide flexible visualizations to help you answer questions such as:
- Which customer journeys are failing most frequently?
- What are the most common issue categories impacting my customer's experience?
- Which of my phone numbers being monitored are more prone to issues?
- How does the performance of one business unit compare to others?

The Cyara Pulse app for Splunk also gives you a running start at building your own dashboards. The included source code can be leveraged and the queries adapted for use in other dashboards where you want to correlate Cyara data with other critical systems within your contact/data center ecosystem, such as your contact center platform (e.g., Genesys, Amazon Connect, Twilio, NICE inContact, Avaya, Cisco), your CRM, and any of the servers and networking devices that support your CX.",false,"Cyara Inc",techcoe,true,460,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/40dcc328-d146-11ec-85ba-b6ed3ce2f2a0.png",5221,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",71,"",splunk,"enterprise

No extra field extractions or CIM compatibility is done.

Instead it uses SEDCMDs to re-format Event Hub message format structure safely. This way Splunk can keep JSON format parsing intact (KV_MODE=json) while overhead in processing and field naming does get reduced. Because of minor changes how data is being indexed upcoming schema changes (new fields) by vendor Microsoft are automatically supported.
Using this add-on will give the following advantages:

- Direct field name access as designed by the original format on the backend, prior data was sent to Event Hub (no more body.properties or body.records.properties prefix prefix in field names for example)
- Cuts off unnecessary fields from Event Hub messages (x-opt-sequence-number, x-opt-offset and x-opt-enqueued-time)
- Ingested data via Event Hub is easier interpreted because of original field names. SPLs and detections are easier to write because field names are kept in original format.

Supports Azure Event Hubs messages sent by:

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
CCX Security Operations has taken it upon ourselves to update and improve the existing SailPoint IdentityNow AuditEvent Add-on for Splunk as to ensure it is as CIM compliant as possible.
This TA was built using a large dataset and endeavors to be the most CIM compliant comprehensive field extraction TA available for SailPoint Audit Events.
The Technical Addon CCX Unified Add-On for SailPoint does not replace the public Splunk Add-on SailPoint IdentityNow AuditEvent Add-on (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4088) but works to enhance CIM field value compliance and tagging, and it is be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

have several MV fields and the use of mvexpand might lose the relationships 
among them.

The command can do sum, average, min, max, range (max - min), stdev, median, and mode.

USAGE
    | mvstats {function} {mv-field}  as {result-field}
Where:
    function is one of:
        sum - add up the values in {mv-field}
        avg - compute the average of the values in {mv-field}
        min - return the lowest number in {mv-field}
        max - return the highest number in {mv-field}
        range - return the difference between the highest and lowest values
        stdev - compute the standard deviation of the values in {mv-field}
        median - return the middle value in {mv-field}
        mode - return the most common value in {mv-field}
    {mv-field} is a multi-value numeric field
    {result-field} is the name of a field to receive the results

    Notes:
    - If {mv-field} contains a non-numeric value then result-field is set to ""NaN""
    - The mode function returns ""NaN"" if more than one value has the highest cardinality.
    - The mode function accepts non-numeric input.

However, many times this information cannot be easily obtained due to the high sensitivity of the applications involved.
Allkun is a suite that allows you to capture information in real time (Allkun Raptor), Process (Allkun CEP), Visualize (Allkun Mon) and Alert Management (Allkun EM).

Allkun Mon for ISO8583 relies on flow data processed by Allkun Raptor and allows you to easily analyze it using Splunk® Enterprise or Splunk® Cloud.

Allkun Raptor allows you to capture transactions from network traffic using a port mirror or network tap and interprets them to a Splunk readable json format. 

This product:
-	Supports transactional protocols like ISO 8583, Visa/Mastercard, H2H, NDC+ and custom protocols.
-	Performs data packet reconstitution.
-	Encrypt and/or obfuscate selected data fields.
-	Output data using tcp, udp, Azure EventHub, http, text file and more.

Allkun Mon for ISO8583 is a basic tool to visualize information captured by Allkun Raptor. It works with a data model based in the ISO8583 standard fields.

This App require the deployment of the following dependencies:
-       Allkun TA ISO 8583 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5139)
-	Flow Map Viz (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4657/)
-	Lookup File Editor (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/)

Within the app there is a pipeline on top of our Machine Learning Toolkit that allows users to follow some simple click-and-select steps to load their e-learning data and select some important features in the data. The app then decides how it should be processed by an ML algorithm – including automatically deciding how the data should be pre-processed in preparation for an algorithm.

Ultimately the app provides non-expert users with a recommended model to apply to their particular data to predict: how likely a student was to pass or fail; and how likely a student was to drop off the course.

As part of this law, US pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders are required to confirm the authorized status of trading partners for transactions and information disclosures, even when there is no prior business relationship.

While larger Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) have connectivity solutions in place, newer and smaller ATPs have not traditionally participated, including tens of thousands of dispensers. This complicates the path of the US pharmaceutical supply chain path to unlock the full potential of the interoperable system mandated by DSCSA.

XATP is a blockchain-backed framework for ATP authentication and enhanced verification in a real-world pharmacy with genuine drug packages. Using just a mobile phone, dispensers can submit supporting documentation to authenticate their identities, and scan 2D drug barcodes to submit drug verification requests to manufacturers. Manufacturers authenticate the identity of requesting dispensers with verifiable credentials and respond to verification requests. These responses can be used to create Product Verification Certificates to support saleable returns.",false,"Alex Colgan",alexcolgan,false,3,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/9c271ee8-6c77-11eb-b2f3-022786c46691.png",5434,"search_raw","Learn More","https://xatp.org/",0,false,true,false,false,"","","","","",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2021-02-16T18:21:33.868339Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_""----"",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[_____","Security, Fraud & Compliance

That's where the ESCU Companion App comes in. Using new features provided by ES 8.0 (but functional in ES 7.0!) the Splunk Threat Research Team has added metadata fields to their ESCU project. The ESCU Companion App uses those metadata fields with some simple dashboards so you can monitor your cloned detections and see which needs to be modified. There is also an alert configured, that you can schedule and add actions such as email or other custom actions (ansible playbooks, SOAR automation, etc.) to instantly notify or take action when a search is detected as being a different version than the ESCU version.

Splunk customers can use BindPlane OP as a high availability aggregator to receive data from many sources, including Splunk Forwarders.  Data can then be processed, reduced, and enhanced before it is routed to Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud or any other destination platform.  Splunk customers looking to adopt open source standards such as OpenTelemetry and OTLP will find that BindPlane OP makes this much easier in multiple ways.

Key Benefits
- Take control of observability costs
- Unify and standardize collection of metrics, logs, and traces into a single pipeline
- Convert signals for maximum effectiveness, logs-to-metrics, traces-to-metrics
- Enhance, mask, tag and route data for compliance and security purposes
- Built on widely accepted open source standards like OpenTelemetry

BindPlane OP Enterprise edition is a paid offering that includes all of the functionality and support large enterprises need to manage observability data at scale.   A Cloud edition and a free Open Source edition of BindPlane OP are also available. BindPlane OP Enterprise is an open source alternative to products like Cribl and Vector.

This Python script is designed to collect information about users who are members of groups exempted from conditional access policies in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD). It interacts with the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve data about conditional access policies and their exempted groups, and then fetches the members of these groups.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Retrieves information about conditional access policies and exempted groups from Microsoft Azure AD using the Microsoft Graph API.
- **Policy Matching**: Filters conditional access policies based on a provided regular expression pattern.
- **User Retrieval**: Fetches members of exempted groups and collects information about them.
- **Output Formatting**: Outputs collected user information in JSON format suitable for consumption by other systems or storage in Splunk.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following:

- **Microsoft Azure AD**: You must have access to an Azure AD instance and appropriate permissions to query conditional access policies and group memberships.
- **Registered Application**: You need to register an application in Azure AD and obtain its client ID and client secret. This application must have appropriate permissions to access the Microsoft Graph API.
- **Python Environment**: This script requires a Python environment with necessary dependencies installed, such as `requests` and `splunklib`.",false,"Daniel Astillero",morethanyell,false,10,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/2a861450-f6bd-11ee-8881-de039c6bbe1c.png",7309,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",64,"",splunk,enterprise,"2024-04-12T09:55:40.624360Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_""-"",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[______""""","Identity Management","identity_management",33,0,0,null,"app_data.json","_json",Q6HDP2WV94,,developer,,,none,"2024-04-12T11:59:32.755333Z",null

vulnerability_scanner",false,"","",false,"2024-03-21T11:21:35.962570Z","This is a Node.js application that serves as a webhook endpoint for importing Veracode Software (www.veracode.com) vulnerabilities into Splunk for further analysis or monitoring purposes.

Here's a break down of its functionality:

Dependencies: The code requires several npm packages such as Express (for creating the web server), body-parser (for parsing incoming request bodies), splunk-logging (for interacting with Splunk), and axios (for making HTTP requests).

Express Server Setup: The code initializes an Express application and sets up middleware to parse JSON bodies in incoming requests.

Routes:

GET '/': This route simply sends a response of 'Veracode Splunk Import' for any incoming GET requests. POST '/veracode': This is the main route where Veracode vulnerability data is expected to be sent. Upon receiving a POST request to this route, the code extracts veracode_project_id and veracode_build_id from the request body. Fetching Veracode Build Details: The code constructs a URL to fetch build details from the Veracode API based on the veracode_project_id and veracode_build_id. It then makes an HTTP GET request to this URL, passing along an API key in the headers.

Processing Vulnerability Data: Once the build details are fetched, the code extracts vulnerability information from the response. It then prepares data objects for each vulnerability, containing details such as vulnerability ID, severity, and policy name.

Sending Data to Splunk: For each vulnerability, the code sends an event to Splunk using the splunk.sendEvent method. It appears that it sends events asynchronously, and it awaits all event-sending promises to resolve before proceeding.

Flushing Events to Splunk: After all events are sent, the code flushes the events to Splunk using splunk.flush. It waits for the flush operation to complete and handles any errors that may occur during the process.

Server Initialization: Finally, the code starts listening on the specified port (or port 3000 by default) for incoming HTTP requests. It logs a message indicating that the server has started.

This application essentially acts as a bridge between Veracode and Splunk, allowing Veracode vulnerability data to be imported into Splunk for analysis or monitoring. It leverages asynchronous processing to handle potentially large amounts of data efficiently.",false,"Vincent  Hinojosa","vhinojosa@veracode.com",false,12,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/78e13398-e775-11ee-aa20-f286b501bd90.png",7277,"search_raw","Learn More","https://github.com/veracodevince/splunk",0,false,true,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",68,"",splunk,,"2024-03-22T07:28:48.988642Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_""----"",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[],___","Vulnerability Scanner

It's painful to search through these log sources when you need them the most, like when you are investigating threats or debugging outages.

Solution: Scanner provides custom search commands in Splunk that let you to query these logs in object storage at high speed. Get answers ASAP, and continue to use Splunk as your single pane of glass. Build reports and dashboards in Splunk that combine results from Splunk and from object storage logs. Your logs in object storage are no longer a blind spot.

The high-volume log sources in object storage are now searchable from Splunk using custom commands. Scanner allows you to search at high speed, especially for needle-in-haystack queries. For example, searching a 100TB log data set for a list of IP addresses, emails, or UUIDs takes only 10 seconds in Scanner. Running the same search in a 1PB log data set takes about 100 seconds. This can be 10-100x faster than tools like Athena, especially against raw JSON logs that have not yet been highly optimized with Parquet and partitioning.

To get started, you will need to sign up for a Scanner instance. When that is ready, there is a setup page in the Splunk app that allows you to set up Scanner API keys and assign them to Splunk roles. Scanner uses the ""storage passwords"" feature of Splunk to store API keys, so roles that interact with Scanner will need the ""list_storage_passwords"" capability.

If you want Splunk to be your single pane of glass where you can analyze both Splunk logs and the logs you have in object storage, Scanner can help you make this happen.

Using Scanner, you can run fast queries against your object storage logs, join them against your Splunk logs, create dashboards from object storage logs, and more.

With your object storage logs easily queryable from Splunk, you can avoid blind spots and get answers rapidly.",false,"Clifton Crosland","ctc@scanner.dev",false,19,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/f4303326-07cf-11ef-84c4-d2e19ff269e0.png",7301,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2024-04-10T07:00:00.185289Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_""--"",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[______""","DevOps

Error diagnostics include a stacktrace, environment and device info, and breadcrumbs. To help with prioritization, errors are grouped by root cause and mapped to users so you can assess the impact of each error. You can also track release health using the crash rate metric to spot spikes in errors. 

The Splunk integration for Bugsnag will forward error information to Splunk as it is received and processed by Bugsnag. Data is sent to a Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC).

Qmulos Apple Compliance addresses the needs of the macOS Security Compliance Project. The app enables enterprises to continuously assess and manage the control posture of macOS systems at the organizational and system-level in enterprises of any size!

Comprehensive Coverage for Today’s Mandates and Beyond
Qmulos Apple Compliance leverages NIST SP 800-219 (macOS Security Compliance Project) to enable macOS endpoint visibility through specific security baselines. The compliance state of macOS systems is evaluated against a range of domains including Audit, Authentication, iCloud, Operating System, Password Policy, System Preferences, and other control categories. Additionally, the Qmulos Apple Compliance integration enables Compliance Scans against macOS systems using a wide selection of baselines reflective of industry-standard frameworks.

Available baselines include:
* Revision 5 of NIST 800-53 (Low, Moderate, High)
* 800-171
* CIS Level 1
* CIS Level 2
* CIS Version 8
* CNSSI-1253
* DISA-STIG
* Qmulos Apple Compliance is fully integrated with existing Qmulos products such as the Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk and Q-Compliance.

We have ensured that the macOS Compliance Scans, the primary driving force behind the Qmulos Apple Compliance integration, are compatible with the Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk. Seamless automation, reduced manual overhead, streamlined compliance lifecycle – all delivered through an easy-to-use graphic interface that doesn’t require your staff to be experts in macOS, Splunk, or compliance frameworks!

Additionally, macOS Compliance Scan rules are all mapped to NIST 800-53 controls, enabling control-specific granularity. The Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk provides rule-to-control mappings, SCAP benchmark and CCE uploads, and visualizations including a NIST 800-53 Score Card, Benchmarks Overview, and Enterprise Overview. Furthermore, macOS Compliance Scans are also integrated with Q-Compliance, and are visualized under the Security Scan Statistics panels which are supported by state-of-the-art Qmulos Alert Management functionality.

As enterprises continue to increasingly embrace Apple devices, maintaining a holistic understanding of the compliance state of macOS systems becomes a mission-critical objective. By leveraging Qmulos Apple Compliance and the macOS Security and Compliance Project, macOS systems can leverage all the operational compliance functionality and the frictionless compliance management experience delivered through the power of the Qmulos Converged Continuous Compliance™ platform.",false,"Qmulos LLC",Qmulos,false,26,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png",6744,"search_raw","Learn More","https://www.qmulos.com/qmulos-apple-compliance-enterprise-compliance-scanning-for-macos",0,false,true,false,false,none,none,"",none,"",68,"",splunk,,"2023-04-17T16:11:18.121283Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_""----"",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[],___","Endpoint

This is the fourth iteration of our product, the same product that we've integrated in telecoms, financial institutions, air traffic controls, across myriad industries, often in mission-critical environments. We can't afford to build a bad product, not just because of our customers, but because we use Infigo SIEM as the heart of our managed security services.

Scheduled Searches can be improperly set to where the time span of the search and the  scheduling differ. This leads to the potential of missed alerts and events or wasteful searches that are taxing your Splunk system with overlapping time spans. 

Scheduled Searches can also lose their ‘owner’ and become an orphaned search, decreasing visibility and longevity of the environment.

Scheduling Inspector also provides an automation feature that will quickly remedy the issues it discovers, enabling your Admins to quickly optimize their environment.

Scheduling Inspector is a component of the Atlas Platform. The Atlas Platform is focused on helping Splunk owners achieve outcomes from their Splunk investment rapidly with prebuilt solutions that address common use-cases, tools that support common workflows, and automation tools that enable Splunk Admins and their Users to do more in less time. Atlas also comes with Expertise on Demand, which gives you access to Splunk experts who can assist you and your Splunk Team with building out use cases and for support of the Atlas and Splunk platforms.

Spend less time searching and more time logically drilling down to determine how events correlate to form a story.

Too often we see customers struggling with these challenges:
- SOC teams spending hours focused on clearing noise instead of focusing on real problems 
- Bouncing from view to view trying to isolate events that caused problems
- Struggling to build a timeline of events to determine if an issue is real or a false positive
- Correlation that is less about correlating different triggering events and more about identifying something that might be considered ""notable""

The Patronus SIEM provides security teams the ability to easily monitor, detect and react to security concerns based on a scoring system that highlights notables and filters out the noise. Spend less time searching and more time logically drilling down to determine how events correlate to form a story.  

A basic scoring system was put in place which applies a certain level of risk to ALL detections.  Those detections become compelling as they grow in score and then generate an incident after a prescribed threshold is exceeded.

We believe that many events generate an incident and a timeline vs every incident representing a single event. This greatly reduces the time spent in lifecycle management and chasing false positives.

Quite simply, time is the asset that is most important to a security team.  
- Time to detection
- Time to investigation
- Time to remediate 

Key Features

Executive View
- There is always an owner for your security team that doesn't care about the details
- High level details of incidents, risks and threats identified

Score based incident generation
- Noise reduction
- Cross-layer risk generation makes for a more reliable incident. Focuses more on the score of the many vs the score of one

Incident Management
- Immutable note taking for incident reporting
- Organized operations for your SOC

Threat Hunting Scoreboard

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on for Tenable Products looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Tenable log sources captured via the Tenable Add-On for Splunk.

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for Tenable (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4060) but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetype ""tenable:ot:alerts"" (Tenable.ot)

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

Features:

This app  has the below list of use cases:

Security Posture	          Use cases to detect and remediate flaws in securing the applications in the network. 
                                          This gives visibility into weak cipher, untrusted certificates,  signature algorithms

Anomalous Traffic	          Detect and remediate challenges with DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic in the network

Troubleshooting	          Detect and remediate network delay, connectivity, and protocol errors in the network. 
                                          For ex server vs network latency, TCP Ip connectivity issues, DNS issues.

Suspicious Activities 	  Detect and remediate issues related to unmanaged devices, suspicious connections,
                                          and traffic outside norms in  the network. 
                                          For ex: IOT unmanaged devices, unwanted services and port misuse

Rogue Activities	          Detect and remediate unsanctioned applications that can pose challenges to your network and security. 
                                          Ex: Unsanctioned p2p Apps, crypto jacking.

M-21-31 Logging	          U.S. Office of Management and Budget M-21-31 logging requirements. 
                                          AMI metadata can be used for HTTPS,HTTP, DNS, Shadow IT, IOMT protocol activity and OT monitoring,

However, to truly realize the value of Splunk Enterprise Security you must ensure that you are ingesting the data sources required to populate the ES dashboards. Without the appropriate data onboarded into your Splunk implementation, ES cannot deliver the value that it should. More importantly, identifying the data sources and prioritizing which data should be brought in first is typically where customers get stuck when attempting to implement ES. A stalled ES implementation leads to valuable time that is lost leaving your organization in a vulnerable state.

Atlas ES Helper is designed to provide you with expert guidance for achieving a successful ES deployment by helping you to identify the data sources that are required to get the real value out of Splunk’s Enterprise Security platform. ES Helper tracks your progress and provides a scoring mechanism that will show you the health of your ES deployment by analyzing your Splunk system.

Atlas ES Helper is a component of the Atlas Platform. ES Helper works with both Splunk Enterprise on premise and Splunk Cloud. The Atlas Platform is focused on helping Splunk owners achieve outcomes from their Splunk investment rapidly with prebuilt solutions that address common use-cases, tools that support common workflows, and automation tools that enable Splunk Admins and their Users to do more in less time. Atlas also comes with Expertise on Demand, which gives you access to Splunk experts who can assist you and your Splunk Team with building out use cases and for support of the Atlas and Splunk platforms.

With 97% prediction accuracy and less than 0.01% false-positives, Augur provides unparalleled security and operational efficiency.

Adversary Profiling Means Better Protection
We are continually building and monitoring a pool of more than 10,000 adversary profiles. We identify new adversaries almost daily. Continuous surveillance means we know when they go live on day zero, and levels the playing field by removing the element of surprise. Adversary profiles also mean we can cover a much broader spectrum of potential threats from the same actor, as opposed to most TIPs which simply alert you of a specific threat when it's already knocking at your network door.

Automated Threat Response
The other radical thing Augur does is it generates Indicators of Attack associated with these future threats. Through our integrations with major security solutions, Augur is able to integrate blacklists into your firewalls, web proxies, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems, DNS servers, and Email gateways. Protecting you against malicious traffic before there is any risk. And when an attack origin is no longer malicious or there is a false positive, we automatically update our blacklists and adjust your security posture.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Extensions for Salesforce look to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Salesforce log sources captured via the Add-ons Splunk Add-on for Salesforce or Splunk Add-on for Salesforce Streaming API.

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for Salesforce (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3549) or Splunk Add-on for Salesforce Streaming API (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5689) but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

This add-on currently provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes:  
- sfdc:loginhistory
- sfdc:setupaudittrail
- sfdc-streaming-api-events:login

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

In a mature Splunk environment it is not uncommon to have scheduled searches that run concurrently using up valuable resources your Splunk environment needs to serve your Splunk users. When your Splunk users are competing with scheduled searches, your users are waiting in the search queue for resources to become available to execute their search or display their dashboard or report. Worse yet, when you have concurrency spikes in your Splunk environment, your searches might be skipped causing critical alerts to not run at all!

Atlas Scheduling Assistant is a powerful tool that not only shows you where scheduled search concurrency exists in your Splunk environment, but also provides you with tools that automatically recommend how to resolve this problem and then gives you the tools to automatically fix the problem. The eliminates the need for Splunk Administrators to spend countless hours searching for and manually testing changes to optimize search schedules. With Scheduling Assistant you can reduce the time to optimization of scheduled searches from days to minutes giving valuable time back to your Splunk Administration Team.

Often industrial processes are used 7*24 and components are sometimes sensitive against timing conditions. To effectively reduce risk, you need to maximize your insight and control of all devices on your network. 

Rhebo Industrial Protector monitors all communication within, to and from the operational technology 24/7. The monitoring is integrated non-intrusively and passively at key points of the OT. Any communication that indicates cyberattacks, tampering, espionage or technical error conditions is reported in real time. This allows early detection of progressive attack patterns as outlined by the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework (see left). Companies can then respond quickly to risks and professional attack pattern to ensure the security and availability of their industrial processes.
By combining Rhebos industrial device visibility, rich contextual device and network properties data with Splunk’s comprehensive data correlation, analytics and incident management, security operations teams can efficiently reduce time to incident identification, analysis and mitigation. They are alerted on relevant anomalies, vulnerabilities and threats for their specific environment.  

Integration of the Rhebo platform with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by UNeedSecurity servicing the Rhebo Industrial Protector App which is not bound to any other technical addons (TA).",false,"Christian Breitenstrom",cbreitenstrom,false,93,err0r,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/c4f690d0-9a71-11ee-afb9-3eec05d42865.png",7094,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",71,"",splunk,"enterprise

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on for Cisco Secure Network Analytics (Stealthwatch) looks to provide a single field extraction bundle for Cisco Secure Network Analytics logs ingested via syslog.
This TA was built using a large dataset and endeavours to be the most CIM compliant comprehensive field extraction TA available for Cisco Secure Network Analytics.

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

Features:
- This TA currently supports logtypes tagged under the following CIM datamodels: Alert, Intrusion Detection (IDS), Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Network Traffic.

Recommended SNA Version:
- Converged Analytics Engine alerting via syslog is introduced in version 7.5 (due December 2023)

Log Format:
 - Cisco Secure Network Analytics (Stealthwatch) log pattern to be followed:

Cisco|Stealthwatch|Notification:{alarm_type_id}|{alarm_type_name}|{alarm_severity_id}|alarm_desc=""{alarm_type_description}"" details=""{details}"" dst={target_ip} src={source_ip} start={start_active_time} end={end_active_time} category={alarm_category_name} alarm_id={alarm_id} source_hg={source_host_group_names} target_hg={target_host_group_names} dpt={port} proto={protocol} device_name={device_name} device_ip={device_ip} domain_id={domain_id} signature={alarm_type_name} vendor_severity={alarm_severity_name} severity_id={alarm_severity_id} alarm_type_id={alarm_type_id} alarm_cat_id={alarm_category_id} alarm_note={alarm_note} alarm_status={alarm_status} policy_name={policy_name}",false,"Matthew Orme",mattheworme,false,103,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/605c10b0-7851-11ee-bb55-e6272a759019.png",7092,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,customer,"Customer License Agreement for App","http://www.cybercx.com.au",customer,"http://www.cybercx.com.au",65,"",splunk,"enterprise

The KO Disablement app is designed to streamline the management of Splunk knowledge objects such as saved searches, reports, and dashboards. It empowers Splunk administrators and users to efficiently enable, disable, or delete knowledge objects within their Splunk environment. By providing a user-friendly interface and powerful functionality, this app simplifies the often time-consuming and complex task of managing knowledge objects.

Motivation:
Splunk is a powerful platform for analyzing and visualizing data, but as organizations scale and data grows, managing knowledge objects can become challenging. Without a dedicated tool, administrators and users may find themselves manually handling each object, which is inefficient and error-prone. The KO Disablement app aims to address this pain point by offering an intuitive solution that saves time, reduces errors, and enhances overall productivity.

Problem Statement:
The KO Disablement app addresses the critical need for a more efficient and user-friendly approach to managing knowledge objects within Splunk. The platform's native management features may lack the flexibility, speed, and convenience required to handle the volume and complexity of knowledge objects in large Splunk environments. As a result, administrators and users may struggle with:

- Cumbersome Processes: Manually enabling, disabling, or deleting individual knowledge objects is time-consuming and prone to human error.
- Lack of Centralized Control: Administrators may find it difficult to monitor and manage knowledge objects across various apps and users efficiently.
- Tedious Troubleshooting: Identifying and resolving issues with knowledge objects scattered throughout the system can be a challenging and time-intensive task.

The KO Disablement app addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, user-friendly interface to enable, disable, and delete knowledge objects across Splunk. With its powerful functionalities, users can seamlessly manage their Splunk environment, improve productivity, and ensure the accuracy and efficiency of their data analysis and visualization processes.

Try the KO Disablement app today to experience a smoother, faster, and more effective way of managing knowledge objects, unleashing the true potential of your Splunk environment. Simplify your Splunk management and elevate your data analysis capabilities like never before!",false,"Cody Quinney",quinneyc,false,119,err0r,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/aa45da12-2cac-11ee-abcf-3676bf61eaa0.png",6986,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",64,"",splunk,enterprise,"2023-07-28T09:47:44.474076Z","{____"""":_,____"""":_"""",____"""":_"""",____"""":_[______""""_",Utilities,utilities,1066,5,2,null,"app_data.json","_json",Q6HDP2WV94,,developer,error,error,none,"2023-08-11T09:17:20.754322Z",null

This add-on allows you to easily convert JSON data to XML format directly within Splunk. Simply pipe your JSON data into the ""convertjsontoxml"" command, and it will automatically generate the corresponding XML output.
The ""JSON to XML Converter"" add-on also includes additional options for greater flexibility. You can use the ""output_file"" option to write the XML output to a file, and the ""exclude_tags"" option to exclude certain XML tags from the output.
With the ""JSON to XML Converter"" add-on, you can now seamlessly transform your JSON data into XML format for further processing and analysis in Splunk.

Example: 
index=myindex sourcetype=""mysourcetype:json"" | convertjsontoxml

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
CCX Security Operations has taken it upon ourselves to improve the existing Splunk Add-on ""Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud"" to ensure it is as CIM compliant as possible.

This TA does not replace the public Splunk Add-on ""Splunk Add-on for Okta Identity Cloud"" available in Splunkbase but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently, this add-on provides additional field extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes:

- OktaIM2:log


Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

Features:
- This TA includes a saved search that populates user details to a lookup that serves to enrich log verbosity and accuracy match for users involved in Okta events (check configuration/installation details) 
- Log truncation support for all available sourcetypes",false,"Henrique Linsmeyer",henriquelinsmeyer,false,170,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/4a3252f8-2f50-11ee-8d6e-1e01bb1da097.png",6988,"search_raw","Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,customer,"Customer License Agreement for App","http://www.cybercx.com.au",customer,"http://www.cybercx.com.au",65,"",splunk,"enterprise

This addon allows you to bring targeted Golden Signals from one or multiple AppDynamics controllers so that you can combine your APM and other data sources in one place. 

Key features:
- Stores data in the Splunk Metric Store (as opposed to an Event Index),
- Supports Splunk Cloud to AppDynamics SaaS connectivity, meaning you do not need shuffle your data to and from private networks
- Easy configuration with simple toggles to control which apps and data types are ingested, based on Google SRE golden signals to target metrics for each type
- Support for all metric types including Application Monitoring (APM), End User Monitoring (EUM), Databases, Servers & Analytics
- Support for multiple controllers, with configuration of HEC endpoint and metric indexes per controller.

This addon doesn't intend to replicate all of AppDynamics' rich diagnostic and metric data into Splunk but targets key metrics to allow you to provide unified summary dashboards alongside your other data and to leverage key metrics in ITSI.

The framework implements a small number of lookups and macros to dynamically suppress events or adjust risk scores for all correlation searches based on any combination of fields within the events. For most Splunk environments, this will enhance analysts ability to quickly tune rules and greatly reduce the lift from Splunk administrators.

**The Tuning Framework for Splunk Risk Score override functionality is not compatible with the Enterprise Security Risk Analysis Adaptive Response **

Analysts can use the Add Entry dashboard to add a combination of correlation search names, fields, and values to tuning lookups which will be used to suppress or adjust risk score for any events that match the specified criteria. This is done by constructing dynamic chunks of SPL to form searches and eval statements based on the contents of the lookups. By doing this, we can use a single lookup for tuning all correlation searches without having to anticipate the different combinations of fields analyst may need to match on. The risk score adjustment works whether you have implemented a macro based version of RBA or are using the Risk Analysis adaptive response action.
