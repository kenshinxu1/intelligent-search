DomainTools enables Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and security analysts to take domain observables from their network and connect them with other active domains on the Internet. Those connections inform risk assessments, help profile attackers, guide online fraud investigations, and map cyber activity to attacker infrastructure.

With the influx in events per second rising, organizations need the ability to execute high-volume queries with improved response times. The DomainTools App for Splunk delivers, with enrichment at scale and drill-down details to add context. Leveraging the DomainTools Iris and Farsight DNSDB datasets, users have immediate access to dozens of attributes attached to every domain event in Splunk, efficiently delivering event enrichment at scale. 

Domain Monitoring

SOCs and Security Analysts can leverage the DomainTools Iris Detect product in Splunk to discover and watch newly registered domains associated with any terms their organization currently monitors (such as a brand or company name), and to monitor domains and append domains to your allowlist (list of trusted domains) from the Domain Investigation workflow. 

Predictive Risk Scoring

DomainTools Risk Score gives teams with emerging threat hunting skills an instant advantage in
helping to identify and optionally alert on Splunk events with suspicious domains they would have otherwise missed. Individual component scores give experienced hunters the tools they need to refine their alerts and precisely target their resources. DomainTools Risk Score, including Proximity and Threat Profile classifiers, is available in both key-value stores and Splunk indexes.

Proven Capability for Enterprise Organizations

DomainTools’ proven solution for Splunk includes a cloud-certified Splunk Application that deploys on Splunk search heads in both standalone and clustered configurations, with and without Splunk Enterprise Security. Event sources can be customized to match the unique requirements of each environment.

DomainTools Capabilities in Splunk

Reduce MTTD
• Bulk enrichment of domains with meaningful context
• At-a-glance alerting and reporting of malicious network traffic 
• Domain monitoring using DomainTools Iris Detect

Reduce MTTR
• Discover newly registered domains and further enable monitoring
• Create a Splunk ES notable event in case a high-risk domain is observed
• Investigate connected infrastructure using Iris and Farsight Passive DNS

This Splunk app will use git to track file changes on a schedule. It can then optionally push the changes to an external repository. This app is useful if you want to know what and when files change in your environment. Unfortunately this app won't tell you ""who"" made a change - but typically you can get a pretty good idea with the help of Splunk audit logs etc. 

Before each run, this app can run a btool dump of various conf files. This is important because individual savedsearches files reorder as they are updated through the UI, which makes diffs ugly. The btool dump is always in a consistent order.

At the heart of the app are several a powerful dashboards that enable the searching of Splunk configurations by conf file, host, app, stanza and/or parameter. Configurations returned are nicely formatted into the familiar stanza, parameter and value Splunk conf file format, along with text based highlighting to aid visualization and readability. There are dashboards for reviewing configuration changes, finding configuration differences, comparing configurations between hosts and identifying installed application differences. 

You can also use Config Quest to navigate through the file system across all your Splunk servers remotely and compare and view configuration files!

To effectively reduce risk, you need to maximize your insight and control of all devices on your network. On average, Forescout customers discover over 25% more connected devices than they knew they had and can collect hundreds more contextual device properties than before. By combining Forescout's complete enterprise-wide device visibility, rich contextual device and network properties data and automated incident response capabilities with Splunk’s data correlation, analytics and incident management, security operations teams can dramatically reduce risk and increase operational efficiency by realizing numerous benefits including:
• Refine security policies by collecting and analyzing real-time device, user and network insight across managed and unmanaged connected devices, including IT, IoT, OT, BYOD and Guest, and regardless of device type or network tier.
• Enhance scope and accuracy of real-time analytics, long-term trend analysis and investigations
• Rapidly detect anomalies, vulnerabilities and threats
• More easily prioritize incidents by leveraging correlated contextual device and event data to prioritize incidents
• Automate closed-loop incident response workflows across the entire incident management lifecycle to immediately mitigate and remediate threats and provide a complete audit trail from incident detection to results of actions taken.

Integration of the Forescout platform with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.

This Forescout Adaptive Response Add-on supports the Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework as follows:
-The Forescout App for Splunk maintains a list of available actions from the Forescout platform. Splunk can instruct the Forescout platform to respond to potential threats by applying any of these actions to endpoints that match search/trend criteria.
-To complete the action flow, the Forescout platform reports the status of actions applied to endpoints.

The Forescout Adaptive Response Add-on enables closed-loop incident response workflows that allow you to streamline security operations and minimize business risk by automating the incident management lifecycle with a complete audit trail that also helps with policy refinements.",false,"Forescout Technologies",alliances4splunk,false,3875,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/251e94f4-3026-11ef-afe7-8a66111fa7eb.png",3383,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",71,"",splunk,"enterprise

The Illumio App for Splunk provides seven visibility dashboards. With east-west traffic visibility, staff can pinpoint potential attacks and identify compromised workloads with Security Operations dashboard. Using the PCE Operations dashboards admins get a single-pane-of-glass to monitor the health of all deployed and managed PCEs. The PCE Authentication Events allows admins to track PCE access.  The Workload Operations and Workload Investigations dashboards provide visibility into VENs with details on workloads that potentially require manual intervention. The Traffic Explorer dashboard provides visualization of traffic flows.  The Change Monitoring dashboard provides an easy way to view PCE creates, deletes, and updates.

This app uses data input and CIM mapping provided by the Illumio TA for Splunk. Please install the Illumio TA for Splunk first.

Note: The Illumio App for Splunk is shipped with Data Model Acceleration disabled, which you can enable to use the full range of the app's capabilities. See the app README for details.


IMPORTANT:  In v4.0, Syslog prefixes are stripped at index-time for JSON-formatted events.  In addition, there are changes in the data schema.
Due to these changes, the search-time extractions and transforms for version 4.0.0 are incompatible with data indexed by previous versions of the TA. See the Upgrade Instructions in the README for more detailed instructions to continue using data collected from an earlier version, and to reconfigure custom searches.

Stamus Networks develops advanced network threat detection and response solutions, including the Stamus Security Platform and the open source turnkey Suricata system, SELKS.

Stamus Security Platform is used by security practitioners worldwide to expose real threats to their critical assets, empower their team’s rapid response, and mitigate their organization's risk. Its network detection and response (NDR) analytics engine that sits atop a unique combination of network security monitoring (NSM), network intrusion detection (IDS) and organizational context allows users to quickly detect, investigate, and respond to threats and security policy violations (unauthorized activity).

The Stamus Networks App for Splunk allows Splunk Enterprise users to extract information and insights from both the Stamus  Security Platform and open source Suricata sensors. It provides dashboards and reports but also a set of commands to interact with Stamus Security Platform via its APIs.

This Splunk Essential for Predictive Maintenance is created for maintenance reliability leaders and engineers who are looking for ways to improve and optimize their current preventive maintenance program.  To do predictive maintenance right, you need to have the right amount of knowledge on how to process data and then apply machine learning techniques to achieve the desired results.   

Designed for interactive learning, this guide focuses on learning how to solve real problems with real data. Users are provided with details of the predictive maintenance methodology and performance data from airplane engine sensors and then asked to operationalize their analytics. 

The Splunk Essentials for Predictive Maintenance takes you through 4 stages of the analytics process.  Each stage covers :
    * Methodology - designed to cover essential analytics knowledge to practice predictive analytics
    * Step-by-step - designed to apply the knowledge to already included dataset.

       - Stage 1: Data collection and ingestion focuses on how you can easily use Splunk software to collect, store, and structure asset metrics (dataset from airplane jet engines included).
       - Stage 2: Data exploration covers key methods for pre-processing and exploring data to help you understand the type of data in use and the characteristics of the dataset, which is crucial for getting the desired outcome.
       - Stage 3: Analysis teaches you 3 key analysis options (Anomaly Detection, Unsupervised Learning, Supervised Learning) for performing predictive maintenance analysis. In the supervised learning section, there is a complete guide to training, creating, and applying machine learning prediction models to predictive maintenance datasets.
       - Stage 4: Operationalization teaches you how to apply the model to a broader implementation, and how to create reports and alerts for operational actions.

Swimlane's Adaptive Response Action can create Swimlane cases pre-populated with Splunk alert and notable event data. 

Configuration

You are able to send alert data to up to 3 separate Swimlane instances with each action.  This is provided so you can
conveniently push to produciton, staging, and development instances with one action.

The global configuration is where you will define the connection info and credentials for your Swimlane instances.
1. In the top left corner of the Splunk interface, open the *app* dropdown menu and select the *Swimlane* app.
2. You will see the configuration page where you can define the host, username, and password for up to 3 Swimlane 
instances.

Alert Configuration

1. Once you have created an alert, go to the alert page and click *Edit* next to the *Actions* field.
2. At the bottom of the window, select *Add Actions* -> *Push Alerts to Swimlane*, then fill out the 
fields appropriately. Setup instructions for `Custom Field Mappings` and `Automappings` are in the next section 

Mapping configuration

For the initial setup, use `Automapping`.
1. In the Swimlane application, Create a JSON field with the *field key* `splunkrawjson` and a multi-line text field with the 
*field key* `splunkfieldlist`.  These two fields can be used to see the data being pushed to Swimlane.
2. Trigger the alert so that the action runs, then check Swimlane to make sure records were created in
the desired application.  if no records were created, check the logs (described in the **Logging** section
below) to debug.
3. Open one of the records that was created in Swimlane.  The fields in `splunkfieldlist` are the fields that are
available for mapping.  You can use `splunkrawjson` to see the value each field contains.
4. For each field that you want to push to Swimlane, either use `Automappings` or `Custom Field Mappings` as
described below.

If you select to use `automapping`, Splunk fields will populate a Swimlane field with the same field key if
it exists.  This is the preferred method of mapping since you can still display the info however you want in 
Swimlane by setting the field display name.

All Swimlane field types are supported and Splunk fields containing lists will be properly translated into
list type fields in Swimlane.

Logging

To find logs in the Splunk search, use the following search string:

index=_internal OR index=cim_modactions OR index=* source=""*push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log""

To access the log file directly, it can be found at:

{Splunk root folder}/var/log/splunk/push_alerts_to_swimlane_modalert.log

If multiple executions happen concurrently, you can distinguish which log message belongs to which execution using the `pid`
logged in each message

General logs that Splunk generates can be found by going to *settings* -> *Alert actions*, then clicking on

into Splunk following the Common Information Model (CIM). The add-on is designed to be compatible with Splunk 
Enterprise and Splunk Cloud with the use of a Universal Forwarder.

This Technology Add-On is intended to import asset and vulnerability findings from the InsightVM Platform without the use of the InsightVM console. The default configuration will import assets and vulnerabilities for devices that have been scanned since the last import run. Key functionality includes:
- Import all asset and vulnerability data when it runs for the first time
- Track previous import times to only import assets and their associated vulnerabilities that have been scanned in the time since the last import
- Vulnerabilities that are newly found or have been remediated will be imported as new events in Splunk and 
respectively assigned a status of ""new"" or ""remediated""
- Previously imported vulnerabilities that have not changed in status will not be imported as new events and will retain their `found` status
- An optional configuration that allows importing all data every run, or every X period of days.

The Rapid7 InsightVM Dashboard and Technology Add-On are recommended in place of the Nexpose Dashboard and Technology Add-On listed on Splunkbase for all InsightVM customers.

To effectively reduce risk, you need to maximize your insight and control of all devices on your network. On average, Forescout customers discover over 25% more connected devices than they knew they had and can collect hundreds more contextual device properties than before. By combining Forescout's complete enterprise-wide device visibility, rich contextual device and network properties data and automated incident response capabilities with Splunk’s data correlation, analytics and incident management, security operations teams can dramatically reduce risk and increase operational efficiency by realizing numerous benefits including:
• Refine security policies by collecting and analyzing real-time device, user and network insight across managed and unmanaged connected devices, including IT, IoT, OT, BYOD and Guest, and regardless of device type or network tier.
• Enhance scope and accuracy of real-time analytics, long-term trend analysis and investigations
• Rapidly detect anomalies, vulnerabilities and threats
• More easily prioritize incidents by leveraging correlated contextual device and event data to prioritize incidents
• Automate closed-loop incident response workflows across the entire incident management lifecycle to immediately mitigate and remediate threats and provide a complete audit trail from incident detection to results of actions taken.

Integration of the Forescout platform with Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is enabled by the Forescout eyeExtend for Splunk module paired with the Forescout App for Splunk along with the Forescout Adaptive Response and Forescout Technology Add-ons for Splunk.

This is a great tool for monitoring Splunk's Web / Frontend & Splunk's Daemon / Backend SSL certificates both if you've specified your own or if you're using the built in certificates.

Now supports automated discovery mode that finds the PEM files you're using to encrypt your Splunk traffic and indexes their expiration date.  Use the dashboard provided as an example to configure alerts, and never let a Splunk cert expire again!

The app provides users a formidable combination of Splunk Enterprise Security’s (ES) powerful analytics, Splunk SOAR’s automation and massive scale along with Mandiant industry-leading threat intelligence, security validation and incident response.

Splunk ingests Mandiant intelligence, performs correlation and analysis, and provides dashboards for visualization. When combined, Splunk and Mandiant enable security professionals to validate their security stack and analyze security events through the eyes of Mandiant cyber security experts.

Maximize Mandiant Advantage with Splunk:

- Mandiant Threat Intelligence delivers the latest threat research directly to the SOC, allowing security teams to quickly see and detect real-time adversary activity. This empowers organizations to better understand the adversary and their tradecraft to make informed decisions and take decisive action. Mandiant intelligence feeds provide insights into well-known malicious actors, malware families, and map to MITRE ATT&CK for strategic response.

- Mandiant Attack Surface Management enables comprehensive visibility of the extended enterprise, so security teams can proactively mitigate real-world threats. Attack Surface Management scans corporate assets and cloud resources daily and identifies application and service technologies. The module assesses risks to the organization, assigns severity, and provides information security teams can use within Splunk to remediate.

- Mandiant Digital Threat Monitoring delivers customized alerts on potential targeting and data or credential leaks. Triggered alerts from monitoring the surface, deep and dark web can be viewed in pre-configured charts via the Splunk visualization tool. These charts provide a high-level overview of alerts and bring what matters most to the forefront in Digital Threat Monitoring. 

- Mandiant Security Validation allows customers to gain confidence in their readiness to withstand cyber-attacks. Mandiant tests the efficacy of control points to block attacks and validates that event information is being sent to and triggering alerts in Splunk Enterprise Security. With Mandiant and Splunk continuously validating the effectiveness of their cybersecurity controls, customers will have real data on how security controls are performing, allowing them to optimize their environments and make the right investments for the future.

- In the face of a suspected or active breach, customers can use the integration between Mandiant Incident Response and Splunk to engage with Mandiant incident response experts with the click of a button. These experts can help customers build their incident response capabilities, respond to active breaches, and bolster their security operations to detect and respond to attacks in the future.",false,"Mandiant Advantage",mandiant,false,7944,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/44e27db0-985e-11ee-8a23-360a0ed4696f.png",6128,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",64,"",splunk,enterprise,"2021-10-07T19:36:20.164954Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_""--"",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[\r__","Security, Fraud & Compliance","security_compliance",140,5,3,null,"apps.json","_json",Q6HDP2WV94,,developer,,,none,"2024-01-04T13:28:34.766969Z",null

The Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics contains the following components:

Splunk_TA_vmware_inframon - Runs a Python-based API data collection engine, collects data from VMware vSphere environment, and performs field extractions for VMware data.
SA-Hydra-inframon - Collects API-based data from vCenter. It schedules jobs and runs the worker processes on each data collection node.
Please install the Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics Indexes (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5602/) in order to define the indexes used by Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics. Follow the Install and Configure Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics Indexes (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/VMWmetricsindexes/CollectData). 

The packages ""SA-VMWIndex-inframon"", ""Splunk_TA_vcenter"" and ""Splunk_TA_esxilogs"" have been removed from Splunk Add-on for VMware Metrics build and published as an individual Splunkbase App in order to make the add-on SSAI-compatible in the cloud environments.

If you would like to collect the vCenter logs from your environment, then install Splunk Add-on for vCenter Logs (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5601/) by following the steps mentioned in Install and Configure Splunk Add-on for vCenter Logs (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/VMWvcenterlogs/CollectData).

If you would like to collect the ESXi logs from your environment, then install Splunk Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5603/) by following the steps mentioned in Install and Configure Splunk Add-on for VMware ESXi Logs (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/VMWesxilogs/CollectData).

Each component and TAs work with a different part of the VMware infrastructure to collect and transform the data into the format needed for the Splunk App for Infrastructure (SAI) and IT Service Intelligence (ITSI).

This app allows you to back up and use git version control to manage your Splunk knowledge objects, such as saved searches, dashboards and macros

Why?
Splunk (as of the time of writing in January 2019) has no native ability to use version control on its knowledge objects. This can lead to issues where an object is accidentally changed or deleted and there is no way to restore them beyond using OS-level backups, which are difficult to use in a search head cluster.

How?

SIEM provides a centralized view for security teams to easily access and analyze security information from a large number of sources, and prioritize mitigation efforts based on risk profiles.

SIEM Integration is a comprehensive solution for capture, retention, and delivery of security information and events in real-time to SIEM applications. Customers using Kona Site Defender, Client Reputation, Web Application, or Bot Manager (BETA) can analyze security events generated on the Akamai platform and correlate them with security events generated from other sources.

System Requirements

Akamai’s Splunk Connector requires Oracle JRE 1.8+. Download the latest from the Oracle Java site (Java Platform, Standard Edition) or install it from a software distribution package on Linux.

You must have Java installed on the host running Splunk Enterprise https://java.com/en/download/

Also, check to make sure that splunk forwarder is NOT installed on your Splunk Enterprise host machine.

Proxy server

To access the SIEM API from behind a proxy server, ensure that your proxy:

whitelists the domains *.cloudsecurity.akamaiapis.net and *.luna.akamaiapis.net
does not interfere with HTTP request headers for those domains. If, due to a strict enterprise security policy, your proxy does change these headers, make sure that at a minimum you allow and don't change the Host and Authorization headers.

It has the ability to alert when hosts stop sending data into Splunk, as well as inspect the last time the final combination of data was received by Splunk.

If the arrival of the final log for the index/sourcetype/host combination is later than expected, the Broken Hosts App will send an alert. This allows for quick status detection of the hosts and fast issue resolution.

The Broken Hosts App for Splunk is the app for monitoring missing data in Splunk. The app’s three main objectives include:
1. Alerting when data is missing from Splunk in order to determine the cause.
2. Utilizing saved searches to facilitate rapid detection of the missing data.
3. Creating dashboards for visualization to help with further investigations.

Most administrators do not possess the specific expertise required to successfully design, deploy and configure a syslog server to properly work with Splunk at scale. Additionally, the traditional Universal Forwarder or Heavy Forwarder approach to syslog collection have several issues with scale and complexity. Some customers send syslog events directly to Splunk to avoid architecting a syslog server, which introduces further problems. To help customers address these issues, Splunk Connect For Syslog (SC4S) was developed, a Splunk open source community developed product.

Splunk Connect for Syslog is a containerized Syslog-ng server with a configuration framework designed to simplify getting syslog data into Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. This approach provides an agnostic solution allowing administrators to deploy using the container runtime environment of their choice. 

The benefits of Splunk Connect for Syslog include the following:
* Repeatable, Concise, and Prescriptive Splunk solution for syslog
* Removal of the UF reduces configuration and management effort
* Turnkey deployment via the SC4S container architecture
* A library of data source filters we will be continually growing with the help of the community
* Exceptionally even event distribution across the Splunk Indexers (benefits search performance)
* Enhanced data enrichment beyond the standard Splunk metadata of timestamp, host, source, and sourcetype
* Easily add custom “filters” for additional sourcetypes beyond those supported out of the box
* Complete deployment documentation

Splunk Connect for Syslog is an open source product developed by Splunkers with contributions from the community of partners and customers. This unique product will be enhanced, maintained and supported by the community, led by Splunkers with deep subject matter expertise. The primary reason why Splunk is taking this approach is to push product development closer to those that use and depend upon it. This direct connection will help us all be more successful and move at a rapid pace.

This app is a consolidated replacement for Phantom Remote Search, Splunk App for Phantom Reporting, and the Splunk Add-on for Phantom.

Splunk SOAR is a Security Automation and Orchestrated Response (SOAR) platform that integrates with your existing security tools in order to provide a layer of “connective tissue” between them. Splunk SOAR streamlines security operations through the execution of digital “Playbooks” to achieve in seconds what may normally take minutes or hours to accomplish with the dozens of products that you use every day.

Splunk SOAR doesn’t replace existing security products, but instead makes your investment in them smarter, faster and stronger.

The Cisco Secure Firewall App is on the move! As part of the collaboration effort between Splunk and Cisco, we are launching a new app designed to provide a seamless experience across multiple Cisco/Splunk integrations. The new app, Cisco Security Cloud, is available at https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7404. It not only supports the legacy 'cisco:estreamer:data' sourcetype but also integrates with the new eStreamer SDK and FTD syslog.

The Cisco Security Cloud app enhances process monitoring to safeguard the integrity of your data pipelines. It also offers visualizations that aid in threat detection and provide comprehensive insights into your firewall solution.

We will continue to support the existing Cisco Secure Firewall App until it reaches its end-of-life (EOL) at the end of December 2024. We value your feedback and encourage you to download the Cisco Security Cloud app to explore its capabilities. Should you have any questions or wish to share your experience, please contact us at splunk_cisco_security_cloud@cisco.com

*******************************
Cisco Secure Firewall App for Splunk presents critical security information from Threat Defense Manager (f.k.a. Firepower Management Center (FMC)) helping analysts focus on high priority security events.  The app provides a number of dashboards and tables geared towards making Firepower event analysis productive in the familiar Spunk environment.  It is an alternative user interface for some, and a complementary interface for others.  Cisco is committed to continuously improving this app based on your direct feedback.

Major Features Include
- Threat Summary Dashboard
- Advanced Impact Event analysis with directionality
- Network Event data dashboard with IoCs and Firewall Rule usage (Allow/Block)
- Context Explorer with Geo-location Map
- Link back from Malware hash to FMC for File Trajectory
- Link Back to FMC for Host Profile
- Filters for CIDR Blocks and Allow/Block Rule actions

Whether troubleshooting individual calls or building high level reporting, it helps you visualize and understand in all areas: agents, users, and huntgroups; concurrency and utilization; call flow; call quality; call volume; devices; failed calls; locations and sites; and audits and compliance.

Your team can trust it as their day-to-day tool for navigating call data from your Cisco CallManager deployment, and it can also become their main tool for building custom reports, alerts and dashboards around that data. This is true whether it’s a standard report you’d expect or a custom report that nothing else has been able to provide.

Note that this isn't a package of content, but more a tank that allows you to drive around in your data.  You won’t find a leftnav full of canned CDR reports to click on (that ""don't quite fit"").  Instead, you get an open flexible framework to investigate anything, drill down into anything, report on anything, over anything, by anything (occasionally with hands-on help from Sideview Support =).

This app is designed for existing Splunk customers interested in migrating to Splunk Cloud, our Software as a Service (SaaS) solution. The app will assess your current Splunk Enterprise deployment that is running on-premises or in a bring your own license (BYOL) model and provide guidance for your migration to Splunk Cloud.

The high-level assessment captured by this app will also provide data points to help our Sales Engineering and PS Teams scope your migration efforts, implement best practices, and prioritize your migration success. For more detailed information on the compatibility of your apps, use the Analysis Of SplunkBase Apps for Splunk.

Note:
This App is self-documenting and will guide you through the experience.  Be sure to follow the in-App guidance.  The calculations in this app are meant to be directional and for educational purposes only.   Results are not guaranteed.

Installation:
This app can only evaluate the data that available in the search results. Therefore, this App should be installed on the Splunk Monitoring Console (MC).  The MC should have access to all Splunk servers in your environment.  This App is compatible with all versions of Splunk 6.5.x and above.  

Quick & Dirty:
Sometimes it is hard to get an App installed, or you might want to do some covert investigations.  To initiate these discussions with your Splunk Account team, run the following search from your Monitoring Console (MC) and save the results.  It is not nearly a complete assessment, but if we can only get the results from one search, this is it:

index=_audit search_id!=""'rsa_*"" search_id!=""'RemoteStorageRetrieveBuckets_*"" search_id!=""'searchparsetmp_*"" search_id!=""'remote_*"" search_id=* total_run_time earliest=-7d@d latest=@d

The App includes Dashboards which will show you:
- The Top Talker IP's, MAC's, Protocols, Ports, VLANs, Conversations
- Detailed overview about IP Conversations, Packet Loss, TCP Error's, Round Trip Time
- Conversation Sankey Diagram (by Packets, by Bytes, by Destination Port) 
- Microburst Dashboard (Bit timechart)
- DNS Overview (Queries over time, Results over time, DNS Response Time)
- NFS Overview (NFS Operations, NFS Response time, NFS Errors)
- HTTP Overview (HTTP Methods, HTTP Status, HTTP Response Time)
- SMB / SMB2 Overview (SMB response time, SMB Operations)
- Keep Alive Communication Dashboards
- Hop Calculator between two IP's

In addition, following protocol fields are already extracted without a dashboard yet:
- MQ

In addition a ""Problem Detection"" Dashboard has been implemented to help during the Wireshark analysis. 

Welcome to the new version 5.x.x of SplunkForPCAP!
There are some important changes made to improve the user experience (compared to previous versions):
- A new python script is taking care about the convertion of your capture file. In the old version it was a shell / batch script depending on the OS
- The new version includes in the raw events the format of field=value - no extra parsing needed for the standard fields
- The converted capture file was before moved away from your initial location - now a new folder ""converted"" will be created in the same location of your capture file
- Starting from now also .pcapng files will be automatically converted - not only .pcap
- The new collection includes also the UDP port details
- The field names have changed for a better understanding


ROADMAP
- Support for more protocols and more use cases
- Dashboards will change to highlight the most important use cases for troubleshooting.

Announcement: 
This is a notice to inform you that support for Splunk Cloud Gateway will end on October 11, 2021.

We’re upgrading and improving the Splunk Mobile and Connected Experiences experience by replacing Splunk Cloud Gateway with a revamped and streamlined application called Splunk Secure Gateway. 

If you haven't done so already, we strongly recommend that you migrate from Splunk Cloud Gateway to the Splunk Secure Gateway app before the End of Support on October 11, 2021.

Splunk Enterprise 8.1 or higher and Splunk Cloud 8.1.2103 and higher already include Splunk Secure Gateway. Enable Splunk Secure Gateway and use the migration feature in the app to migrate your devices.

If your Splunk deployment is running versions below these Splunk platform versions, update your Splunk Cloud Gateway app to version 1.13.3 before October 11, 2021 to continue using the app without interruption.

This app, formerly known as the “Phantom App for Splunk,” is responsible for sending data from your Splunk Enterprise/Cloud instances to Splunk SOAR. Once that data is in Splunk SOAR, you can perform automated actions with over 350+ different security tools. 

Also included with this app is an integration with Splunk Enterprise Security, allowing you to send ES data to SOAR.

Splunk SOAR is a Security Automation and Orchestrated Response (SOAR) platform that integrates with your existing security tools in order to provide a layer of “connective tissue” between them. Splunk SOAR streamlines security operations through the execution of digital “Playbooks” to achieve in seconds what may normally take minutes or hours to accomplish with the dozens of products that you use every day.

Splunk SOAR doesn’t replace existing security products, but instead makes your investment in them smarter, faster and stronger.

If you are using the Splunk Add-on for Kinesis Firehose as well as the Add-on for AWS with your Splunk instance, then you must uninstall the Kinesis Firehose Add-on before upgrading the Add-on for AWS to version 6.0.0 to avoid any data duplicacy and discrepancy issues. We encourage all customers who have a use case for Kinesis Firehose to adopt the Splunk Add-on for AWS v6.0.0 as soon as it is available as the Splunk Add-on for Kinesis Firehose will be discontinued in the future.

This app contains over 30 unique searches that will help you identify suspicious activity in your Office 365 and Azure environment.

Requirements:
This app relies on the data collected in the Unified Audit Log. 

There are several ways to export this data out of an environment:
1. Exporting the data using the Office 365 Extractor (https://github.com/PwC-IR/Office-365-Extractor) 
Full disclosure this app was built by a colleague and me. 
2. Getting the data from the API which can be achieved with the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Office 365 
3. Using the Office 365 Security and Compliance web portal

Dependencies:
The custom timeline app is used for one visualisation and can be found here:
https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3120

Getting started:
- Update the macro `ual` to the index where your UAL data is stored.

Important:
- Please send me feedback via GitHub.com/invictus-ir
- Support the development of the app https://www.buymeacoffee.com/invictusir

UPDATE Mar 29, 2023

** The Upgrade Readiness App (URA) on Splunkbase is for ON-PREM ENVIRONMENTS ONLY. 
** CLOUD environments get new URA versions WITHIN SPLUNK CORE RELEASES. Upgrading URA ahead of Splunk Core Releases is not supported at this time.
---

The Upgrade Readiness App is an extension of the Splunk Python Upgrade Readiness App. In addition to scanning your deployment for features and code that might not work with Python 3, jQuery vulnerabilities, and 9.0 checks.

Use the Upgrade Readiness App to prepare your deployment for upgrade to Python 3, jQuery 3.5, and Splunk version 9.0 readiness. This app can scan Splunk apps installed on Splunk Enterprise version 7.3 and higher and Splunk Cloud Platform 8.2.2107 and higher.

The app's scan results describe the remediation actions you must take to ensure that your public and private apps work as expected after you are upgraded to a new version of Python on the Splunk platform, as well as actions you must take to remove dependency on vulnerable versions of jQuery. For example, scan results show if any apps and customizations rely on Python 2. This is important as support for Python 2 is being phased out of Splunk software.

On Splunk Cloud Platform, the Upgrade Readiness App provides these additional features:
     - Scan search heads and indexers and view a combined report from both types of instances.
     - Request an upgrade of the default Python version from Python 2 to Python 3.

The Upgrade Readiness App is a tool that assists you with your transition from Python 2 to Python 3, jQuery 3.5, and Splunk version 9.0 readiness. Even if your deployment passes all checks, you must still independently test your private and customized apps and add-ons for incompatibilities.

The Upgrade Readiness App comes with Splunk Enterprise 7.3 and higher, as well as Splunk Cloud Platform version 8.2.2109 and higher. You do not need to install the app on these versions of Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud Platform.

This version of the App enforces Python 3 for execution of the modular input script when running on Splunk 8+ in order to satisfy Splunkbase AppInspect requirements.
If running this App on Splunk versions prior to 8 , then Python 2.7 will get executed.

This App is fully AppInspect passed for installing in your own hosted Splunk Enterprise environments or on your own hosted Splunk Forwarders and forwarding the collected data into Splunk Cloud.


Installing the App directly in Splunk Cloud :

This App is designed to be completely generic enough to allow users to connect to any RESTful or HTTP(s) endpoint with any permutation of HTTP options (Headers , URL arguments , Proxies , Certificates, Authentication Schemes , etc..) , not to mention custom response handling, paging and in-flight preprocessing of received data. 


But to allow for this completely generic capability we need to provide options over and above what Cloud permits. So we take the following approach to provision the App for customers wanting to install the App directly in Splunk Cloud for their specific configuration requirements.

If you want to install this App directly in Splunk Cloud , for our Commercially supported customers on our Ultra plan ( https://www.baboonbones.com/#support )  we provide custom private builds of any of our Apps tailored to the customer's specific requirements and configuration , and these custom private builds can then be uploaded as your own private Splunk Cloud Apps.

For customers that don't have support,  we also offer the option to perform ad-hoc custom private builds of any of our Apps.

Custom Visualizations give you new interactive ways to visualize your data during search and investigation, and to better communicate results in dashboards and reports. After installing this app you’ll find a timeline visualization as an additional item in the visualization picker in Search and Dashboard.

A timeline visualization shows activity time intervals and discrete events for a resource set. Activity for each resource appears in a separate timeline lane. If an activity start time and duration are available for a particular resource, the timeline shows a duration interval as a horizontal bar in the lane. If only the start time is available, the timeline shows a circle at that time.

Splunk App for Data Science and Deep Learning
The Splunk App for Data Science and Deep Learning (DSDL), formerly known as the Deep Learning Toolkit (DLTK), lets you integrate advanced custom machine learning and deep learning systems with the Splunk platform. The app extends the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) with prebuilt Docker containers for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and a collection of data science, NLP, and classical machine learning libraries. When you use the predefined workflows of Jupyter Lab Notebooks, the app enables you to build, test, and operationalize customized models with the Splunk platform. You can leverage GPUs for compute-intense training tasks and deploy models on CPU or GPU enabled containers.

Splunk Community for MLTK Algorithms on GitHub

The reason this is needed is because Splunk doesn’t log *everything* about itself, and the _audit index could use with more detailed auditing.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on CCX Microsoft Windows Sources Extensions looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Windows log sources captured via Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows installed on Splunk agents (UF).

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/742/) but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sources:  

- XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational
- WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational
- WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on for Crowdstrike Products Extensions looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Crowdstrike log sources captured via the Add-on CrowdStrike Falcon Event Streams Technical Add-On or CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight Vulnerability Data.

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for CrowdStrike Falcon Event Streams (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5082/) or CrowdStrike Falcon Spotlight Vulnerability Data (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6167) but works as an additonal extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes ""crowdstrike:spotlight:vulnerability:json"" and ""CrowdStrike:Event:Streams:JSON"" including the following log subtypes:  

- ActivityAuditEvent
- IdentityProtectionEvent
- CustomerIOCEvent
- IdpDetectionSummaryEvent
- IncidentSummaryEvent
- ScheduledReportNotificationEvent
- RemoteResponseSessionStartEvent
- RemoteResponseSessionEndEvent
- EppDetectionSummaryEvent
- XdrDetectionSummaryEvent

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

## Overview
This TA collects data from Mimecast Awareness Training API, specifically the ""Get Campaigns"" and ""Get User Data"" endpoints.  

## Releases
Version 2.0.0 was released on 19 July 2024. It is now built on top of Splunk Add-on Builder.

## Requirements and Configuration
To configure an input after installing this app, go to the app's Inputs landing page and hit Create New Input. You will need to supply the the following:  
- Grid or Tenant API URL  
- Access Key
- Secret Key
- App Id
- App Key
- Launch Date
	- This is your organization's chosen start of Phishing Simulation Campaign
	- Multiple phishing simulation emails may be sent over the course of few days and this date should be the very start of the campaign
- End Date
	- This is the desired end date of the Phishing Simulation Campaign
	- Some users may still action (e.g. Click, Report) on simulated phishing emails but your may not want these data to avoid changes in already-established score or result
- Include All User Data
	- A checkbox that will ignore the Campaign End Date
	- When this is checked, users who actioned on simulated phishing emails will still be ingested but will have a field `isOutsideCampaignPeriod` with a value of `True`
  
The recommended interval for an inputs stanza is once per day. You may immediately turn off the collection after just one successful collection.

## Troubleshooting
See the collection's logs by querying internal logs, such as:

```
index=_internal sourcetype=tamimecastcampaigns:log 
| transaction pid source
```

This combination makes Q-Compliance the most complete compliance monitoring and reporting solution on the market.  Unlike legacy IT GRC tools––glorified databases to organize policies, paperwork, historical security posture snapshots, and status notes––Q-Compliance adds real-time measurement of your systems’ actual compliance states across all controls, and even automates system security plans. As such, Q-Compliance is the first solution to truly add operational security value to the paradigm of “check-box” compliance.

As the complete solution, Q-Compliance is centered around the NIST SP 800-53r4 Controls Catalogue, supporting use cases within the Commercial and Public Sector markets through  adoption of the NIST RMF or CSF.  

Furthermore, Q-Compliance includes workflows, overlays, and reports.

We harness the world’s most exclusive team of security researchers and give them access to a powerful platform for trusted security testing. That testing yields vulnerabilities, data to measure attack surfaces, and provides documentation to aid compliance.

The Synack App for Splunk provides an easy way to bring live, up-to-date Synack data into your Splunk environment. By putting IT, Security, and Synack-discovered vulnerability data in one place, richer reporting, analytics, custom dashboards and queries are available to reduce the effort and time to gain insights. It comes with an out-of-the-box dashboard, or users can customize their use of Synack data.  

Common use cases include:
• Security Operations - Integration of vulnerability data into the Security Operations Center (SOC) and related workflows enables security teams to get more efficient and streamline your security stack
• Threat Hunting - Find evidence of active or past threats using verified, Synack data about true exploitable vulnerabilities
• Incident Management - Efficiently bring incidents to conclusion using all available data sources
- Web logs: Correlate exploitable vulnerabilities & locations with web logs to determine if there are other locations where this vulnerability can be exploited
- IPS/IDS: Correlate exploitable vulnerabilities & locations with network traffic to define new rules for detection and prevention
- Scanners: Correlate exploitable vulnerabilities with scanner data for better scanner efficacy
- Threat Intel: Correlate exploitable vulnerabilities & locations with Threat intel to build out predictive patterns
• Custom Reporting & Analytics for the above scenarios, or other workflows in your security organization

	Download and install the Splunk app to monitor the duration and the status of Commvault jobs. You can also monitor Commvault logs.

Install the App:

    1) From the Commvault Store or SplunkBase, download the Splunk app.
    2) Log on to the Splunk URL.
    3) From the Home page, click the settings button.
		The Apps page appears.
    4) Click Install app from file.
		The Upload app page appears.
    5) Browse to and select the Splunk app file, and then click Upload.

Before You Begin:

    1) On the computer where the indexer peer nodes are configured, configure the receiving port.
		To configure the receiving port, from the Home page, navigate to Settings > Forwarding and receiving > Configure receiving > New Receiving Port.
    2) On the computer where the receiving port is configured, create a new index. You can also use an existing index if you have one on the computer where the receiving port is configured.
		To create a new index, from the Home page, navigate to Settings > Indexes > New Index.

Configurations:

    * Set up the CommCell page: On the CommCell tab, enter the webserver URL. Enter the CommCell user name and password, and then click Add CommCell.
		Append the webserver URL with the IIS port number, such as :. The default port number is 81.
		
    * Set up the Commvault Clients page: On the Commvault Clients tab, select a CommServe client, and then click Submit. From the Unmonitored Clients section, select the CommServe client and other    clients to monitor. Click Monitor Selected Clients.
	
	*	Set up the Splunk Configuration page: On the Splunk Configuration tab, from the IndexName list, select the name of an index. Enter the IP of the indexer and the receiving port number. Click Submit.

		If you have not installed the Splunk software on the Commvault client computer, depending on the operating system installed on the client computer, enter the Windows or UNIX path of the Splunk forwarder software. You must enter a .msi file path for Windows and a .tgz file path for UNIX.

		If you have another Splunk software running on a client computer, configure the outputs.conf file to point the forwarder to the computer where Splunk indexer is installed. Also, enter the credentials of the Splunk software in the Forwarder Configuration Table. Ensure that this client computer is a monitored client.

Result:

	On the Commvault Dashboard tab, you can see the pie charts of the duration and the status of Commvault jobs. Click the pie chart to get the job details. Click on a job ID to get the job logs.

Additional Information:

	To view the events for troubleshooting, you can check the SplunkPlugin.log file in the SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/commvault/local folder.

Insights alerts administrators with timely warnings and/or suggested optimizations for the systems in your implementation, for example:

    Operations - an outage is about to occur
    Security - a new CVE is affecting your systems
    Business - overspending on resources is taking place

The application integration with Splunk either uses Insights APIs to collect data and perform tasks in a similar way to a client that you would create yourself, or subscribes to streams of Insights events. The method you use depends on your targeted use case.

Red Hat Insights application for Splunk forwards selected Insights events to Splunk. The application seamlessly integrates with Red Hat Insights, so that you can focus on handling the data on the Splunk application side, in the same way you manage other sources of data.

Insights is included as part of your Red Hat subscription, and is accessible through Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.

Installation and initial configuration are automated, so setting up the integration is quick and simple.

By moving through the stages of maturity, organizations can get the most out of Splunk technology and improve their security posture. 

Please work with your Splunk account representative to use this assessment.

Here are some of the benefits of achieving a higher level of Splunk adoption maturity:
Improved security: Organizations that have achieved a higher level of Splunk adoption maturity are better able to identify and respond to security threats.
Reduced costs: Organizations that have achieved a higher level of Splunk adoption maturity can reduce the cost of security operations by automating tasks and improving efficiency.
Increased compliance: Organizations that have achieved a higher level of Splunk adoption maturity can improve their compliance with regulations by collecting and storing data in a compliant manner.
Improved decision-making: Organizations that have achieved a higher level of Splunk adoption maturity can make better decisions by having a better understanding of their security posture.

If they differ, the suggested change is shown in the ""definition_data"" field. There could be a difference because some data is no longer present and the macro could/should ""shrink"" or because there is new data and the macro could/should ""expand"" or perhaps you no longer have any data coming into Splunk that is tagged for your datamodel.  In the latter case, you need to investigate and if the data is still there, get it tagged correctly and if not, get it put back in, or if not, unaccelerate the datamodel.  Use the ""URL"" field (cut & paste to browser) to jump directly to edit any datamodel's index macro.

This app also contains a set of macros to greatly increase the flexibility and accuracy of SIEM drilldowns (there is an example correlation search that demonstrates this).

This app and the slide deck referenced below were developed independently, but there is a great deal of common concepts and overlap so it is a perfect primer:

Currently, there seems to be no easy way to report on 
and dump out all all your alerts without clicking the mouse 1000+ times
 - especially if you have say 800+ alerts defined and running.

Wouldn't it be nice to have the ability to dump out
all of the Splunk alerts you defined to a .csv file and review all your alerts with Excel?

Now you can.

This app provides a way for an organization or an individual to convert user defined alerts
contained in internal splunk savedsearches.conf files to a user friendly readout provided by a .csv file.

When you save searches and create alerts - Splunk stores them for you in a number of savedsearches.conf files.

You may have alerts defined in only one savedsearches.conf file or in many 
savedsearches.conf files depending on if different users are defining their own alerts.

The work flow to dump out the alerts is fairly easy:

First install this app.

Then select the app.

Once the app is selected:

The app has a search bar.

Enter a search of "" |  exportalerts list"" (without the "")  to get a list of where your savedsearches.conf files are stored.
For a list of relative paths to your savedsearch.conf files enter ""| exportalerts list"". 

Then run the search again with ""| exportalerts PATH "".  Where the PATH is a path you have cut and pasted from 
the ""| exportalerts list"" search 

The "" | exportalerts list"" command or search will give you a list of one or more paths to the savedsearch.conf files relative to this app.

Highlight and cut or copy each line and paste it into the "" | exportalerts "" command as a suffix.

For example:

| exportalerts ../../search/local/savedsearches.conf

Would be a correct search string to cause the app to list your alerts defined in this particular savedsearches.conf file

And once you get a list of your alerts then:

Lastly save this search with all your alerts listed below as a REPORT. 
Then run the report and export as a csv file.

To export a report as a .csv file - look in the far upper right of the app screen for a downward pointing arrow
into a horizontal bar. This is the export / download to .CSV icon which you want to use from a REPORT.

You can only download to a .csv file when you SAVE your search as a report.

For example: You located a savedsearhes.conf file and you issued ""| exportalerts ../../username/savedsearches.conf"" file and you see alerts below. 

Next - open the report. You will see the alerts listed below in the report.

Go to the upper right menu bar of the report. Look for export and export to .csv. The symbol / icon is a downward arrow into a horizontal line.

You can name the .csv file and it starts to download from your browser.

Once the .csv file is downloaded to your desktop use Excel.

For more detailed help on how to use this app:
Select this app in the drop down. 
Then for help type in the search bar: ""| exportalerts help"" without the "" 
for the full help work flow.",false,"Jeffrey Fall",jeffreyfall77,false,1093,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png",4536,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2019-06-07T21:12:03.182921Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[\r____","Utilities

In addition a new BALANCED savedsearch.conf file will be written LOCALLY in the app for a user to download and install in their Splunk Enterprise system if desired.

A balanced savedsearches.conf file will have the alerts and saved searches all running hourly using each of the 60 minutes in the hour to host an alert or alerts in the most resource conserving manner as possible.

If your Splunk Enterprise system is MISSING or SKIPPING alerts then this app is essential and will allow you to evaluate your alert schedule and optionally install a new balanced savedsearches.conf file which retains all of your alert settings. Just the timing is set to hourly for all your alerts.  This will save you DAYS of using the mouse and Splunk GUI to reschedule your alerts.

Give this app a try.
At least list out your alert schedule to an easily readable .csv file.

The goal of this tool is very simple: It brings all the Information you need to create CIM compliance TA or check an existent TA at one single point. That´s one main problem, to find all needed information because they are widely scattered, but the SA CIM developers do a great job and documented they work right in the data models. 
In addition, the apparently confusing logic of the CIM makes it hard to find a clear way to find all the relevant field mappings. The funny story is that CIM tries to normalize the Information and itself is full of redundancies und and double field names with different meanings. Of course, there is a leeway between being precise and a global view. This tool can help you balancing on the line.

The CIM Buddy shows you which fields are relevant while you develop a TA with CIM compatibility and present the result of your development. You can examine if your fields are mapped correctly, if tagging works or what the SA CIM searches write into the data model.

The Multi-cloud Cost Management for Splunk App is designed to give insights into your spending across cloud services. It allows you to see which services are costing money unnecessarily in an attempt to make recommendations as where to make a reduction in spending throughout your Cloud Environments. The current cloud services that are supported are Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure, and Google Cloud.

This app provides a set of dashboards and saved searches to help to give insights into where savings could be found within your cross-cloud infrastructure without reducing the performance.

This app retrieves up to date costing from AWS, Azure and GCP using API calls to give accurate cost saving estimates based on recommendations regarding changes to your Cloud Infrastructure.

GBP and USD conversion is support across all cost estimations and summations. Conversion rates are onboarded hourly by default. Default values are also configurable. Fuctionality is also set to change the conversion rate on the fly.

Dashboards:
General Spending Overview - Shows historic spending trending

VM Instances - Shows data regarding unused VM's and what component of this VM is costing money

VM Utilization - Shows system utilization statistics suggesting which VM's should be investigated for downsizing

Volumes - Summarizes data surrounding unattached volumes and the accumulated cost of these

Elastic IPs - Displays information regarding both unused and unattached public ip addresses that cost money through reservation charges",false,"Apto Solutions","apto_support@aptosolutions.co.uk",false,1259,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/06c3c024-3e79-11ed-8cd7-aa5da4d43c56.png",4602,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","End User License Agreement for Third-Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2019-07-19T16:35:56.180643Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[\r____","IT Operations

The insights provided by CYFIRMA correlates IOCs with malware associated with active hacking campaigns, threat actors and next-action planned by cybercriminals to give security operations team the ability to respond to malware with improved efficiency and effectiveness. The collaboration allows security teams to identify newly created malware that is being used in cybercrime communities before it is seen by any cybersecurity controls. Equipped with the capability to detect malware, viruses, malicious payload in the wild, hackers’ methods, techniques to infiltrate, infect and exfiltrate, the collaboration allows security teams to detect an attack before it impacts their environment. Organization can take identified malwares in the wild, their behavioral pattern, and apply on EDR, XDR, NDR, perimeter security controls to proactively defend against unseen threats.

CYFIRMA DeCYFIR App for Splunk gives security leaders the much-needed control to get ahead of cybercriminals. Based on analysis of threat indicators collected from the deep web, dark web, hacker forums and other closed communities, as well as CYFIRMA’s own research, attacks can be predicted using probability prediction models and analytics engines. By providing threat intelligence from the outside, CYFIRMA can share early warning information when signs of cyber-attacks are detected, enabling cyber teams to take rapid action to thwart attempts at intellectual property theft, ransomware attacks, and other malicious activities. With UI App for Splunk, security operations team are equipped to search for malware, campaigns, threat actors and more, and create their personalized dashboards.

uberAgent Helpdesk is a Splunk app for IT professionals who support virtual or physical desktops and who need to resolve issues quickly. The helpdesk app provides a different view of the regular dataset collected by uberAgent. As such it requires a working uberAgent infrastructure on Splunk.

uberAgent is an innovative Windows and macOS user experience monitoring and security analytics product for physical and virtual endpoints.

uberAgent's UX highlights include detailed information about boot and logon duration (showing why and when boots/logons are slow), application unresponsiveness detection, network reliability drilldowns, process startup duration, application usage metering, browser performance per website, and remoting protocol insights.

On the security side, uberAgent provides deep visibility at a low data volume through its flexible process tagging engine for identifying risky activity with predefined rules for many common threats.

The advanced logging app for Cisco WSA redefines monitoring and troubleshooting by aggregating diverse logs from Cisco WSA devices. A standout feature is its unparalleled ability to parse and visualize the typically concealed prox_track log, unconfigurable through the GUI. Positioned as both a replacement for and a valuable addition to traditional SNMP-based monitoring, this app excels across various crucial areas:

Overview:
Comprehensive display of all WSA proxies with current and peak values. Metrics include requests per second, CPU/RAM/Disk load, and server/client connections.
Timings and Load Values:
In-depth insights into various timings and load values for Authentication, DNS, and other essential modules.
Comparative Analysis:
Unique functionality to not only display values but also facilitate the comparison of metrics between different systems.
Internal Visibility:
Leveraging track_stats/prox_track.log, the app provides a profound view into the internal workings of WSA.
Correlation Graphs:
Build correlation graphs illustrating the relationship between requests per second and system load, enabling the identification of potential bottlenecks.
Audit View:
A dedicated audit view to track user logins and monitor system changes, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of system activity.

normal user. See the README.txt for installation.

Please respect people's privacy and adhere to the service's acceptable use (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#AcceptableUse). I tried respecting the limits posed on the API's use in the command's source code, which is why you'll have to have a little patience when querying for large amounts of mail addresses.

I was unsatisfied with the publicly available Splunk add-ons already providing this functionality as they either didn't allow control over what and how is queried for or didn't format the output to my wishes. So I came up with my own Splunk add-on implementing these missing features.

Cross-compatible with Python 2 and 3. Tested on Splunk Enterprise 9.0.2 and 8.2.3 on Windows, Linux and Splunk Cloud.

Generating Commands
KV Store Backup: Backup KV Store collections to the file system on the search head.
KV Store Restore: Restore KV Store collections from backup jobs*. Lists all existing backups in the default path if no arguments are given.
KV Store Push: Copy KV Store collections from the local Splunk search head to a remote instance or comma-separated instance list (SH/SHC)*.
KV Store Pull: Copy KV Store collections from a remote Splunk search head (SH/SHC) to the local instance*.
Delete Key: Delete KV Store records from a collection based on user input.

Streaming Commands
Create Foreign Key: Creates an entry in a lookup and appends the resulting _key value to the current search results. Useful for writing linked entries in two lookups.
Delete Keys: Delete KV Store records from a collection based on _key values in search results.

Alert Actions
Send to Collection: Similar to outputlookup, but can be toggled on/off by users that have permissions to edit search jobs without modifying the search. This functionality has been implemented by Splunk directly into the product since this was written.

* Deletes the collections from the target host before writing (unless otherwise specified).

** Notes to SplunkCloud SRE:
- This app must be installed on Enterprise Security searchheads  (NOT IDM), and includes a modinput, which must be allowed to run on the searchhead.  This app will not work on an IDM, indexer, or a search head which does not have Enterprise Security.  
- This app's modinput contains checks to ensure that it will only run on the cluster Captain when installed on an ES SHC.  
- The modinput fetches cyber threat observables from TruSTAR's REST API and posts them to the searchheads' kvstores using the kvstore ""batch_save"" endpoint, not an index as most modinputs do.  This is why it must run on the searchheads, not an IDM.  There is no config option that would allow the user to tell the modinput to post the observables to that endpoint on a different host, it's hard-coded to post to ""localhost"".
- This app is compatible with ES SHC, but its ES SHC compatibility is implemented in a way which requires replicating ""inputs.conf"" from all Splunk apps on the stack to all nodes in the SHC  by setting ""conf_replication_include.inputs = true"" in ""server.conf"".   This is standard for all Splunk apps created using Splunk's Addon Builder.  If this behavior is problematic for other Splunk apps on the user's SHC, user will need to decide which app they prefer to use:  TruSTAR Unified or the app with which that conflicts.  See SINT-3685 for more details / information. 
- The app contains modactions that need to be available on all ES SHC nodes, so the app needs to be installed on all SHC nodes.

This app provides two JSON-specific search commands to reduce your search and development efforts:

* jmespath - Precision query tool for JSON events or fields
* jsonformat - Format, validate, and order JSON content

In some cases, a single jmsepath call can replace a half-dozen built-in search commands.  Sound too good to be true?  The jmespath command can parse nested JSON strings and unroll arrays {Name: x, Value: y} hashes with ease.  Checkout the examples and try it yourself!

NOTE:  The 1.0.x series is stable and the 1.9.x release are in preparation for 2.0.0. Some backwards compatibility changes are planned and several things aren't yet set in stone.  Contact us if you have any concerns or would like to be involved.

**Our team recently discovered security vulnerabilities in this app that have been fixed in version 2.2.0.**

# What You Need to Know #
We discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in the AppInspect App for Splunk, which affects the upload endpoint in the application. This could essentially allow attackers to access restricted directories and execute commands. Additionally, a SSRF vulnerability was found. In order to take advantage of these vulnerabilities, the user would need to have successfully authenticated to the Splunk instance. 

Both of these issues have been resolved.

Please note that this affects **all versions** of the AppInspect App for Splunk app **prior to version 2.2.0**.

# Recommended Course of Action #
If you have the app installed on any non-local machines, it is recommended to remove or update the AppInspect App for Splunk as soon as possible.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Why an app for AppInspect? (So Meta) #
An easy way to send your Splunk Apps to AppInspect's API.

# Who is this app for? #
- Anyone who builds Splunk apps. The goal is to make the process easier as well as making sure you are always validating
your app against the newest version of AppInspect.

# How does the app work? #
- This app works with the https://api.splunk.com REST API
- Your .tar.gz or .tgz file will be uploaded into this app's local directory and then removed once it has been
sent to AppInspect for validation.
- Only the most recently generated AppInspect report is kept on disk. A copy of this is located in the
app's local/reports/ directory

# Steps to use: #
1. Login using your Splunk credentials
2. Click or drag and drop on the file drop area (must be a tar.gz/.tgz)
3. Modify settings to fit your specific needs
4. Wait for results

The app detects seasonal patterns and finds anomalies in just a couple of clicks.


Using the app, you can create anomaly detection jobs, run these jobs on a regular cadence, view SPL queries, and create alerts. The app works with any time series dataset that can be ingested into the Splunk platform, provided the points in the time series are evenly spaced.


The app uses machine learning to detect seasonality in the data without user inputs, lowering the barriers to realizing value. The app also performs health diagnostics on the time series to check whether the dataset is suitable for anomaly detection using our algorithm. If the dataset is not fit for anomaly detection with our algorithm, we have included steps to preprocess the data in the docs. (We are working on supporting more time series out of the box without preprocessing steps for the next version).


When you create an anomaly detection job, the app generates an SPL query you can view and use elsewhere within Splunk.


Similar to other Splunk applications, the resource consumption of CPU and memory is commensurate with the size of the datasets that you use.

The primary goal of the application is to add contextual information and situational awareness from DNSDB to your existing event data. DNSDB is the most comprehensive historical database of passive DNS data about how IPs, domains, and Internet infrastructure are interconnected and have evolved.  

By augmenting your internal organization's information with real-time Internet infrastructure information, your team will have better visibility for the detection, identification and analysis of threats and adversary infrastructure and capabilities. Your team is able to click on any IP or domain in Splunk to generate a DNSDB query to learn about its history and related infrastructure. You can also add this capability to your existing workflow to auto generate the query and populate the contextual information.

Farsight Security DNSDB is the world’s largest DNS intelligence database that provides a unique, fact-based, multifaceted view of the configuration of the global Internet infrastructure. DNSDB, is used by security teams to qualify, enrich and correlate cyberattack data such as IP addresses and domains to save time during an investigation and remediation. Farsight collects Passive DNS data from its global sensor array with more than 100 billion domain resolution records and updated in real-time at over 200,000 times/second.

A fundamental tenet of BitSight’s SPM solution is the ability to contextualize an organization’s cybersecurity performance over time. Leveraging meaningful metrics that are independently verified to correlate to breach risk, this view of “performance over time” ultimately guides the organization in its effort to reduce cyber risk to achieve desired business outcomes. The advanced security performance analytics facilitate a universal understanding of the organization’s cyber risk aiding business leaders and board members delivery of effective cybersecurity program oversight for the organization. 
Security leaders and their teams rely on BitSight SPM to:
     - Continuously monitor the effectiveness of security controls
     - Facilitate uniform performance targets across the organization
     - Provide in-depth comparisons of the organization’s cybersecurity performance against peers
     - Streamline program management decisions, including the ongoing remediation of security controls
     - Communicate program performance to non-technical stakeholders using meaningful context

Bring BitSight SPM into your security program through this integration with Splunk.

It supports both Atlassian Jira Cloud and Atlassian Jira Server versions. Automatically detects which APIs need to use. 
Features:
1. Cover all standard necessary fields in Atlassian Jira for issue creation such as Project, Summary, Issue Type, Priority, Description, Assignee, Labels, Components.
2. Add the result of Splunk Alert into the Jira issue at the end of the description field. There are two possible views of added data
    1) The table view where the table head consists of Splunk Alert result fields
    2) The list view when the result of Splunk alert will be added as a Jira code snippet.   
3. Possibility to use one additional custom field to create Jira issues. 
4. Control what information from Splunk Alert will appear in Jira issues. Pass search result values dynamically into Jira issues.
Not necessary to use a digital ID of values in the Jira field. All fields take human-readable values. 
Sample: you have a Jira project with the short name “CORP” with id=2331. In the configuration of Splunk Alert, you don’t need to use the Id of Jira Project. You need to use the name of Project “CORP”.  Atlassian JIRA Issue Alerts add-on will automatically convert human-readable values into digital Id.
5. Possibility to assign issues to specific people even if you don’t know UUID in Jira Cloud.

The basic idea is to first encrypt data within an event and produce a new file with the same content as before, but with the data matching group(1) in a regular expression encrypted and saved on disk using base64. The next thing to do is index the newly required file into Splunk with a sourcetype.

At search time, you will then be able to decrypt the data. Read the README.txt for installation and usage. Two experimental dashboards have been added for Splunk 6+ that you can use in your own app to control access to decrypt.

Often industrial processes are used 7*24 and components are sometimes sensitive against timing conditions. To effectively reduce risk, you need to maximize your insight and control of all devices on your network. 

Rhebo Industrial Protector monitors all communication within, to and from the operational technology 24/7. The monitoring is integrated non-intrusively and passively at key points of the OT. Any communication that indicates cyberattacks, tampering, espionage or technical error conditions is reported in real time. This allows early detection of progressive attack patterns as outlined by the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework (see left). Companies can then respond quickly to risks and professional attack pattern to ensure the security and availability of their industrial processes.
By combining Rhebos industrial device visibility, rich contextual device and network properties data with Splunk’s comprehensive data correlation, analytics and incident management, security operations teams can efficiently reduce time to incident identification, analysis and mitigation. They are alerted on relevant anomalies, vulnerabilities and threats for their specific environment.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on for Sophos XG Firewall looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Sophos Next Generation Firewall log sources captured via Syslog.

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on Sophos Next-Gen Firewall (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6187) but works as an additonal extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently, this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for the following sourcetypes:

- sophos:xg:content_filtering  
- sophos:xg:firewall
- sophos:xg:event
- sophos:xg:sandbox
- sophos:xg:anti_spam

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

The framework implements a small number of lookups and macros to dynamically suppress events or adjust risk scores for all correlation searches based on any combination of fields within the events. For most Splunk environments, this will enhance analysts ability to quickly tune rules and greatly reduce the lift from Splunk administrators.

**The Tuning Framework for Splunk Risk Score override functionality is not compatible with the Enterprise Security Risk Analysis Adaptive Response **

Analysts can use the Add Entry dashboard to add a combination of correlation search names, fields, and values to tuning lookups which will be used to suppress or adjust risk score for any events that match the specified criteria. This is done by constructing dynamic chunks of SPL to form searches and eval statements based on the contents of the lookups. By doing this, we can use a single lookup for tuning all correlation searches without having to anticipate the different combinations of fields analyst may need to match on. The risk score adjustment works whether you have implemented a macro based version of RBA or are using the Risk Analysis adaptive response action.

You can use ACS features to update your API white list and add ip address of the current management splunk node.

For more information about  ACS and IP Allow List, please visit: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/9.1.2308/Config/ConfigureIPAllowList


#Features :
This Application contains  four  main features:

-  Manage Servers :  This feature facilitates the management of Splunk Cloud stacks. Add, modify, delete stacks or categorize them under different groups.  The only prerequisite is to have a valid authentication token to be able to initiate communications with the Splunk Cloud Stack.  
    
-  Manage Content: In this view, the user will have the flexibility to choose Splunk configurations or full applications and then select one of the predefined actions to process them.  This will offer an automated method to perform multiple actions on multiple apps/configurations and deploy them to multiple stacks.  
The user will be guided in a user friendly wizard to select content and targets, review all that and then  **deploy or schedule**  the deployment job.

- Check and Compare stack's Content : This feature enables administrators to list all installed applications on Splunk Cloud stacks, verifying their versions and detecting any newer releases for Splunkbase apps.  The compare mode activates when more than one stack is selected, displaying common applications (to verify if an app is installed on all selected stacks) and ensuring version consistency across all selected stacks.

- Manage Workflows:  A workflow represents a predefined set of actions that users/Admins can create and customize. Users have the option to craft new workflows by selecting actions from a library of predefined ones:  
    * Deploy:  deploy packages or configurations to splunk cloud stack(s)  
    * Inspect:  Inspect packages with AppInspect  
    * Save to disk:  Save generated packages to disk  
    * Push:  push to a CI/CD Pipeline.",false,"Atef Kouki","akouki_splunk",true,269,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/c1720786-02d2-11ef-916c-322dcf8115ca.png",7062,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,sgt,"Splunk General Terms","https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",sgt,"https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",71,"",splunk,"enterprise

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Extensions for Airlock Digital Add-on look to provide field extraction and CIM compliance for Airlock Digital log sources captured via the Add-on Airlock Digital or via HTTP Event Collector (HEC).

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Airlock Digital Add-On (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5674) but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

This add-on provides field extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes ""airlock:svractivities"" and ""airlock:exechistories"".

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

- You use Splunk Enterprise to **collect and centralize your production or security logs** and you would like to have a system to monitor all these logs in order to identify specific elements (called artifacts).
- These artefacts may represent a threat to your business and **you want your security teams to be able to detect those artifacts** and remediate any incident linked to them.
- In addition, **you want to make the time spent by your analysts on the detections found in your logs profitable**. If your analysts have spent several hours identifying an alert as a false positive, you would like to be able to ""qualify"" the alert so that the next time an event matching this qualification (or signature) is detected, a different automated treatment is performed (such as not being alerted if it was considered a false positive by your teams)

Technically speaking, this TA allows you to :
- Easily set a monitoring on specific artifacts (IP, URL, Mails, Hash, Username etc.) stored in KV stores and be alerted when one of your event match at least one artifact thanks to the Splunk automatic lookups
- You can organize your artifacts through cases, also stored in KVStores, to link them and attach them a tag to have a specific process in case of a detection
- For every detection, you can choose the way you want to centralize your alerts and select a qualification for a specific signature (which relies on event types in Splunk)
- You can customize your qualifications/signatures in order to have specific process (for example, receive an alert in case of a NEW alert and not be alerted when the alert is qualified as FALSE POSITIVE), this is done by having saved searches on which you can customize the actions when The Watch events are detected.

The main concept of this tool is to identify events from known information (IP, URL or any other field extracted by Splunk) without having to create a new search for each artefact, without necessarily knowing which sources are analysed but also to capitalise on the time spent on our investigations.",false,"Alexandre Demeyer",letmer00t,false,290,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/0c8ccd10-40d2-11ed-be44-f21d8487e317.png",6611,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,mit,"MIT License","https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",mit,"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2022-10-03T16:43:03.557191Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_""-"",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[\r___","SIEM

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
CCX Security Operations has taken it upon ourselves to improve the existing Splunk Add-ons ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add On"" and ""Proofpoint TAP Modular Input"" as to ensure it is as CIM compliant as possible.

This TA does not replace the public Splunk Add-ons for ""Proofpoint On Demand Email Security Add On"" and ""Proofpoint TAP Modular Input"", but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently, this add-on provides additional field extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes:

- pps_messagelog (Proofpoint On Demand Email Security)
- proofpoint_tap_siem (Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection - TAP)
- ccx:proofpoint:trap:hec (Proofpoint Threat Response Auto-Pull - TRAP)

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

Features:

The UiPath Robotic Process Monitoring (RPM) for Splunk is an application for monitoring UiPath RPA deployments.  The App provides a quick setup, and out of the box visibility into your RPA reliability, performance, and security.  You can also calculate ROI metrics for time saved and dollars saved for any Process Automation.  The App also includes a full bi-directional integration with the UiPath API through Splunk Alert Actions.  This gives full data loop feedback directly in real-time to restart Robots, restart stalled jobs, or event kick off other Automations in UiPath. 
 
Setup:

See the Details tab for dependencies and setup instructions.  Configuring data collection is only a two step process: 

1. UiPath Webhooks pushing events to Splunk HEC for Job, Queue, Robot, Process events
2. Splunk Universal Forwarder running on UiPath Orchestrator for collecting UiPath Execution logs

Privacy:

RPA technologies automate business process that touch many systems and API's.  RPA configurations may include in their execution logs process names, systems accessed, credentials used, etc.  Splunk has many configurations that can mask or obfuscate data fields in flight, at rest, or in search.  Please reference this documentation if you have these concerns. https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Data/Anonymizedata

Sepio Systems has developed the Hardware Access Control (HAC-1) solution to provide a panacea to the gap in device visibility. The HAC-1 solution uses Layer 1 information to calculate a digital fingerprint of all IT, OT and IoT assets, meaning every device gets identified as what it truly is. Additionally, the comprehensive policy enforcement mechanism of the HAC-1 solution, combined with its Rogue Device Mitigation capability, means that any unapproved or rogue hardware is blocked instantly, preventing any hardware-based attacks from occurring. With the HAC-1 solution in place, not only is the hardware level covered but, in doing so, current cybersecurity investments, such as NAC, EPS, IDS, or IoT Network Security, get put to better use and Zero Trust Hardware Access is achieved.",false,"amir ki",amirki,false,396,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/a26b9724-bf45-11ee-94a7-0a98a46948f5.png",6519,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",64,"",splunk,enterprise,"2022-07-20T14:15:56.807909Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_""------"",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_","Security, Fraud & Compliance","security_compliance",1362,0,0,null,"apps.json","_json",Q6HDP2WV94,,developer,,,none,"2024-05-15T12:40:13.911332Z",null

The process of implementing these configurations to a system can be complex and extraordinarily time consuming. In addition to remediating STIGs on all system components, you must be able to effectively report on and continuously monitor the compliance posture of your systems as they evolve over time. In a lot of cases, this process is managed with Excel spreadsheets and other tools that don’t allow you to get real insights into the data being captured in your compliance body of evidence. Worse yet, the manual nature of completing this work can be time consuming and very prone to human error.

KGI’s Atlas platform includes the STIG Compliance Application that is designed to assist with the entire process of putting systems into a compliant state, managing the compliance body of evidence, and reporting on the state of your system STIG compliance. This is accomplished by bringing your compliance data into the Atlas STIG Compliance App from your STIG checklists and vulnerability scanning systems. The Atlas STIG Compliance solution also includes an integration with Puppet that is capable of putting your RedHat systems into a compliant state and then sending real-time data about the current state of your systems over to Splunk. The makes the Atlas STIG Compliance a comprehensive solution that encompasses STIG Compliance reporting and remediation.

Key Features of Atlas STIG Compliance:
- Create and define systems that represent your environment or your accreditation boundaries.
- Visualize your compliance status at a system and system component level to better understand the quality of your systems.
- Automatically Ingests any STIG or SRG Checklist into Splunk.
- Track STIG Compliance posture over time to build an audit trail of your compliance activities.
- Easily update comments, finding details, status and more for your STIG Checklists within Splunk.
- Save time by bulk editing all of checklists at one time from the Splunk UI.
- Export your STIG Checklists from Splunk in the .ckl format so that they can be opened in the DISA STIG Viewer or imported into external systems.
- Allow teams to collaborate on STIG Compliance activities inside of the Splunk UI.
- Quickly audit your STIG checklists to identify checklists that have missing comments or finding details in your compliance body of evidence.
- Automatically identify discrepancies between your STIG Checklists and your vulnerability scans (SCAP and ACAS).
- Create custom POA&M reports that can be exported from Splunk.
- DISA STIG Templates are included in the App and are visible in the STIG Library feature

Questions they must answer include: ​

What devices are impacted? ​
Where are the devices located? ​
Who's using those devices? ​
What OS and software are the devices running? ​
Is there a software vulnerability on the device? ​
What information is contained on the device, and is it sensitive or confidential information? ​

Knowing the answers to these questions helps to pinpoint the threat and its potential impact, and prioritize the next actions. Alerts don't typically come with this information, however, even though all of it is essential for accelerating response time and stopping an attack. While teams spend time hunting down IT asset data, the attack could be spreading rapidly, causing massive damage. Threat investigations and responses are performed faster and at scale across complex or expansive IT infrastructures when IT asset enrichment data is instantly available within the SOAR solution.

This Splunk app integrates with Lansweeper to perform investigative actions:

1.test connectivity: Validate the asset configuration for connectivity using supplied configuration
2.list authorized sites: Retrieve authorized sites from Lansweeper with their ID(s) and names

To enable rule streaming, configure Jobs in the Continuous Content Management (CCM) module of the SOC Prime Platform and specify them in the App's data input. Jobs are configured with Content Lists to select rules for deployment, Presets to automatically modify the rules' parameters, and Filters to include additional conditions. You can also set up and apply Custom Field Mapping profiles to make the names of indexes, fields, and even field values in the rule code match your custom data schema.  

To obtain rules via the CCM module and stream them into your environment, you need access to the SOC Prime CCM API. For more details on the API, see our Platform Guides: https://help.socprime.com/en/articles/6265791-api (to open the Guides, you need to be logged in to your SOC Prime Platform account).

(Ok well you can - anyone who’s ever used their lips as a high-pressure air nozzle for a Nintendo cartridge or shaken the computer a few times and it started behaving may disagree - but I assert this is blind luck and don’t condone proactive violence)

With Splunk dashboards - and especially complex Splunk dashboards - keeping track of tokens can be a nightmare. Your end users may not be super-tech-savvy. They may have NO idea what’s going on with Splunk under the covers.

Introducing the Dashboard Helpdesk. Dashboard Helpdesk gives Splunk Admins (and any other level that provide troubleshooting) the ability to see the holistic user experience at the time they experienced the issue.

User account info? ✅
State of the Splunk environment? ✅
All installed apps? ✅
User environment? ✅
SCREENSHOT OF THE DASHBOARD? ✅
TOKENS? ✅

…wait. which tokens?

All of them. The form tokens. The dashboard tokens. The default token model. The submitted token model.

AND, with some of the parameters, you can see in real-time (yes, real REAL time, not near-time or “real” time) a comparison of the current state of the parameters versus the state when the person submitted the issue report.

Compatible with Splunk versions from 7.2 to 9.0, and in Splunk Cloud and Enterprise, enabling this functionality requires only installing the Dashboard Helpdesk app.

The only (for now) configurable bit is the index in which you’d like to story the issue report.

Download or install the Dashboard Helpdesk today from Splunkbase to (don’t use the cliche supercharge, Paul) to wormhole qualifying issues your end users have from 5-6 hops to 0. With only 4 lines of code on any #SimpleXML dashboard, Dashboard Helpdesk starts working its magic.

Bring the ultimate observability to your Splunk dashboards!

The Search Assistant for Splunk (beta) uses machine learning to simplify the experience of getting insights from a corpus of logs. It is a great place to start if you are new to Splunk and want some interactive guidance to search through your log data. It takes just a few clicks, and there’s no guesswork! After inputting a log dataset, the assistant automatically runs a set of pre-set SPL queries and ML models, and presents the results in a simple way.

* Setup *
See the Details tab for dependencies and setup instructions.

It relies on the Splunk built-in archiving capabilities and Azure blob storage and tables via the usage of the Python SDK for Azure.

The framework and concept can be summarised the following way:

- Splunk automatically calls the AzFrozen2Blob.py Python script when a bucket is frozen from cold storage (assuming archiving is enabled on the index)
- The Python script accesses an Azure storage account and verifies in a pre-defined Azure storage table if that bucket ID has been archived already (management of buckets replication for Splunk indexers in cluster)
- If the bucket has not been archived yet, a tgz archive of the bucket is created and uploaded to the pre-defined container in Azure blob
- If the upload to blob is successful, the Python script inserts a new record in the Azure storage table with all the useful information related to this bucket
- If the upload is successful, the script exists with an error code=0 which instructs Splunk that the bucket can be frozen, otherwise the script exit=1 and a new attempt will be made automatically by Splunk

pinpointing outstanding data needs, all while dynamically updating the validation criteria as your environment evolves.

Embark on a simplified data management journey with the DataSense Navigator, a tool designed to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights within the Splunk environment. Traditionally, the journey from data onboarding to use case development is often disjointed. This fragmentation can lead to overlooked use case considerations, necessitating time-consuming adjustments later on.  DataSense Navigator integrates the analysis of use case and data preparation requirements right from the start, reducing delays and avoiding the hassle of rework.

The DataSense Navigator addresses the industry's evolving needs by offering a streamlined, data-centric approach that automates the identification of use case field and data model requirements, enhancing efficiency and accuracy significantly. It tackles various scenarios including:

•	Efficient Use Case Discovery: Speeds up the identification and recommendation of use cases based on existing data quality, aiding in future planning, especially when partial prerequisites are met.
•	Data Quality Validation: Conducts a thorough examination of event presence within vital data models for ES use cases, offering a clear insight into data quality.
•	Priority Setting for Data Quality Improvement: Pinpoints gaps in field extractions or configurations, aiding in precise effort planning and prioritization of data quality improvement tasks.
•	Post-Configuration Push Impact Analysis: Assesses the effect of configuration changes on use case coverage, helping to identify success or the need for further adjustments.
•	Structured Workflow Facilitation: Accommodates varying expertise levels with its structured yet interactive workflow design, guiding users to insightful conclusions regarding data and use case gaps.

One distinguishing feature is its Event-Specific Subsampling Techniques, which moves away from the traditional approach of analyzing large data sets in aggregate, to examining each event on an individual basis. This feature, along with minimal configuration, automatic adaptation to all data models, and an integrated user-friendly workflow, not only addresses the identified problems but also serves as an educational tool, illuminating each stage of the analysis process.

The current landscape of data onboarding and use case enablement faces scalability challenges leading to time-consuming processes, with existing tools falling short in unifying use case quality assessment and development. The DataSense Navigator emerges as a solution in this scenario, easing the transition to a more accessible, efficient, and insightful Splunk experience.

Beyond Identity’s integration with Splunk feeds real-time data about the users and devices attempting to access your critical cloud resources across applications. When Splunk is integrated with Beyond Identity, security teams can ensure only secured devices and authorized users access company data. This stops all password-based attacks and definitively blocks lateral movement, feeding real-time risk signals into Splunk Enterprise Security to help improve threat detection and incident response.  
 
Beyond Identity continuously gathers data concerning the security posture of registered devices and forces their adherence to organizational device security policies.  Real-time risk-based authentication is informed by dozens of user and device risk signals during each login - enabling customers to enforce continuous, dynamic access control across the cloud applications and resources used to operate your organization. 


When Splunk is integrated with Beyond Identity, security teams get:

Strong Authentication Beyond Identity eliminates passwords as an authentication method and cryptographically binds user identity to the device via the secure TPM hardware on the device. This eliminates credential-based attacks and provides a very high assurance of the user identity before allowing access to critical SaaS resources. 

Granular Risk Signals and Immutable Logs Beyond Identity  captures granular device security posture data at the exact time of login such as operating system version,  security software state, and device type. Authentication event data is captured and aggregated in the Beyond Identity Administrative Portal for every login attempt. 

Identify Risky Users Beyond Identity stops unauthorized users and rejects devices from authentication if they do not meet an organization’s security requirements. Unauthorized devices that are not bound to a valid identity are stopped from authenticating. All authentication data is fed into Splunk and normalized to inform threat detection defense                                                                                                  

Event Mapping to CIM Beyond Identity injects data from every authentication attempt into Splunk’s Common Information Model to extract insights about the security posture of device-bound users, their authentication attempts, and the rejection of those who failed to satisfy device security requirements.

SecurityScorecard is a security ratings platform that enables enterprises to instantly rate and understand the security risk of companies, non-intrusively and from an outside-in perspective. We use an A-F rating scale. Companies with a C, D or F rating are 5.4 times more likely to be breached or face compliance penalties than companies with an A or B rating. Our platform is used by hundreds of customers for use-cases including vendor risk management, cyber insurance, board reporting, and M&A. Headquartered in New York City, we are funded by top investors like Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, NGP, Moody’s, Intel, and others. Our vision is to create a new language for companies and their partners to communicate, understand, and improve each other’s security posture.

Compatible with all cybersecurity solutions, it immediately enhances your detection with contextual information about internal and external cyber threats specifically targeting your business.

Main benefits for user :

INCREASE YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND VISIBILITY OF FUTURE CYBER THREATS
LastInfosec's technology continuously inventories and evaluates data sources accessible through multiple channels: social networks, specialized sites, the darknet and the deep web, to collect indicators of compromise that are enriched and contextualized to your activity, with the objective of reducing the time required to analyze a threat when it is detected

SAVE TIME FOR YOUR SOC ANALYSTS
LastInfoSec makes it easier for your operational security teams to make decisions and drastically reduces their analysis and incident response time without changing their internal processes. The time saved increases the quality of alert coverage.

REDUCE RISK
LastInfoSec has a library of millions of indicators of compromise (IoCs). Its automated collection, analysis, and correlation engines make threat information available an average of 24 hours ahead of the competition with over 5,500 new validated and enhanced markers per day.

REDUCE NOISE AND FALSE POSITIVES
Because our data is enriched and contextualized beforehand, it generates only meaningful alerts and includes all the information needed to understand them. False positives from your solutions or other Threat Intelligence sources are also mitigated by correlation with our CTI feed.


If you need information about the access and Cyber Threat Intelligence feed, you can contact us with https://info.gatewatcher.com/en/fr/lp/splunkbase

The Gatewatcher LastInfoSec CTI Feed App (gwlastinfosec) helps you download, parse and use
LastInfoSec Threat intelligence IOC data feed directly from your Splunk searches.
It helps to visualize the downloaded data with the 3 dashboards:
- GW LastInfoSec - IoC Explore: last IoC table with search (first 50 rows)

No extra field extractions or CIM compatibility is done.

Instead it uses SEDCMDs to re-format Event Hub message format structure safely. This way Splunk can keep JSON format parsing intact (KV_MODE=json) while overhead in processing and field naming does get reduced. Because of minor changes how data is being indexed upcoming schema changes (new fields) by vendor Microsoft are automatically supported.
Using this add-on will give the following advantages:

- Direct field name access as designed by the original format on the backend, prior data was sent to Event Hub (no more body.properties or body.records.properties prefix prefix in field names for example)
- Cuts off unnecessary fields from Event Hub messages (x-opt-sequence-number, x-opt-offset and x-opt-enqueued-time)
- Ingested data via Event Hub is easier interpreted because of original field names. SPLs and detections are easier to write because field names are kept in original format.

Supports Azure Event Hubs messages sent by:
* Microsoft 365 Defender Streaming-API - Advanced Hunting telemetry like: DeviceAlertEvents DeviceProcessEvents DeviceNetworkInfo DeviceLogonEvents DeviceEvents DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilitiesKB etc.
* Azure Blade monitor logs - Azure platform telemetry like: AuditLogs SignInLogs NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs ServicePrincipalSignInLogs ManagedIdentitySignInLogs RiskyUsers UserRiskEvents etc.",false,"Dirk Groben",bahndg,false,556,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/5208a73c-34f3-11ed-a85e-5249fa697a14.png",6508,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",65,"",splunk,"enterprise

What is/are infotools you ask???

This app is a collection of custom commands that let you see information from the search head that may normally require access to a command shell or file system.

In version 1.2 there are 11 custom commands:

| lookupinfo - see the location size and modtime of lookups

| bundleinfo - see what inside the latest search bundle

| userinfo - lists all files in the etc/users directory with size and modtime

| appinfo - lists all files in the etc/app directory with size and modtime

| btoolinfo - yet another btool output (blocked in Splunk Cloud)

| artifactinfo - view or search the info.csv file in search artifacts

| pinginfo - run a ping from your search head to measure latency or availability

| sslinfo - run the openssl s_client to view certificate details

| varinfo - see the size and modtimes of files in the splunk/var directory

| cliinfo - run the splunk cli commands: status, list, show, display, help (blocked in Splunk Cloud)

| specinfo - view the details of the .conf.spec files

Each of these commands is a generating command (must be first command in the pipeline) and return results about the file objects.

What is the use case for infotools?

Glad you asked...

In Splunk Cloud and with many on-premise deployments most users do not have access to the file system.
It can be very useful to be able to see details about some specific Splunk files to help with troubleshooting.

For example:

One of the most common problems in many environments is large lookups file affecting bundle replication
the restapi commands for lookups do not return information about the file size if the lookup is not defined in transforms.conf, so you need access to the file system to see this information

In a search head cluster, large lookups that are frequently updated can impact performance since the entire file is replicated to all members
since lookupinfo provides the modtime, you can see if a lookup has been recently updated",false,"Splunk Works",splunklabs,true,558,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/80784d64-3561-11ef-964e-fa8cd1f72dbf.png",6308,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,sgt,"Splunk General Terms","https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",sgt,"https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",65,"",splunk,"enterprise

Where:
    function is one of:
        sum - add up the values in {mv-field}
        avg - compute the average of the values in {mv-field}
        min - return the lowest number in {mv-field}
        max - return the highest number in {mv-field}
        range - return the difference between the highest and lowest values
        stdev - compute the standard deviation of the values in {mv-field}
        median - return the middle value in {mv-field}
        mode - return the most common value in {mv-field}
    {mv-field} is a multi-value numeric field
    {result-field} is the name of a field to receive the results

    Notes:
    - If {mv-field} contains a non-numeric value then result-field is set to ""NaN""
    - The mode function returns ""NaN"" if more than one value has the highest cardinality.

The reason this is needed is because Splunk doesn’t log *everything* about itself, and the _audit index could use with more detailed auditing.

As part of this law, US pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders are required to confirm the authorized status of trading partners for transactions and information disclosures, even when there is no prior business relationship.

While larger Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) have connectivity solutions in place, newer and smaller ATPs have not traditionally participated, including tens of thousands of dispensers.

XATP is a blockchain-backed framework for ATP authentication and enhanced verification in a real-world pharmacy with genuine drug packages. Using just a mobile phone, dispensers can submit supporting documentation to authenticate their identities, and scan 2D drug barcodes to submit drug verification requests to manufacturers.

## Overview
The Wiz Virtual Machines Splunk TA is designed to collect and ingest logs from Wiz's Cloud Resource Inventory, specifically targeting discovered Virtual Machines. This TA simplifies the process of retrieving and analyzing your cloud infrastructure data within Splunk.

## Features
- Automated creation and retrieval of Wiz reports.
- Ingests discovered Virtual Machines from Wiz as individual Splunk events.
- Extracts and uses the ""Last Seen"" timestamp from the CSV report for each event.

## Requirements
- Splunk Enterprise 9.x or later
- Access to Wiz's Cloud Resource Inventory
- Wiz Client ID credentials with permissions to create and retrieve reports

## Installation
- Download the Wiz Virtual Machines Splunk TA package.
- Log in to your Splunk instance.
- Navigate to Apps > Manage Apps.
- Click Install app from file.
- Upload the downloaded package and click Upload.
- Restart Splunk if prompted.

## Configuration
- After installation, navigate to the TA's configuration page.
- Enter your Wiz API credentials.
    - Wiz API Client ID in the Username field
    - The associated Client Secret in the Password field
- Go to Inputs tab to create a collection (inputs stanza)
    - Give it a unique name
    - Set the desired interval for report generation and retrieval (recommendation: not less than 12400)
    - Select the index
    - Select the Client ID you just created under the Global Account dropdown menu
    - Enter the Project ID to filter your results, leave the asterisk to collect everything
- Save the configuration.

## How It Works
- The TA generates a report in Wiz's Cloud Resource Inventory.
- It waits for the report to be completed.
- Once the report is complete, it retrieves the report in CSV format.
- Each row of the CSV is ingested as an individual Splunk event.
- The timestamp for each event is derived from the ""Last Seen"" field in the CSV.

This Splunk TA uses the `GET /groups/?$search=""displayName:{keyword}""` parameter and loops through all the groups to get their members. The looping API call uses `GET /groups/{group_id}/members?$select=id,userPrincipalName,displayName,jobTitle,accountEnabled`. That means each event ingested into Splunk look something like:

```
{
   @odata.type: #microsoft.graph.user
   accountEnabled: true
   displayName: deGrasse Tyson, Neil 
   id: 81201000-501ce31b9d-6e2f738-36e8acb-a3eb1755
   jobTitle: Astrophysicist
   memberOfGroupDisplayName: Harvard-University-Science-Communicators
   memberOfGroupId: f79d732c-de0d87fa0d-5a6ec03-f0a1ba-a13092e43
   userPrincipalName: neil.degrasse.tyson@scienceyoutubers.com
}
```

Every event does not have time and uses the CURRENT_TIME or the local time of the Splunk server that's processing this collection.

## Why You Would Want to Use This
While the [Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Azure](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3757) can collect groups and expand collections by members using Optional Parameters, it does not support using Microsoft Graph API's Advanced Query capabilities due to the limitations of `$search` and `$expand` being used together (see this [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/aad-advanced-queries?tabs=http#query-scenarios-that-require-advanced-query-capabilities)).

Given this limitation, your organization may have use cases where you need to collect members of specific groups that match a particular nomenclature. For instance, your organization might need to list all users who are members of groups matching the name ""MFA Bypass"". 

Using the Splunk TA for Azure, it can be very resource-intensive (ingest, storage, CPU, and memory) to log everything and filter at the SPL level. This TA addresses that by allowing you to collect only the necessary group members based on specified display name patterns, making data collection more efficient and targeted.

## Usage
- Have a Client ID, Client Secret provisioned for you. This Client/App ID must have the same permissions as the prescribed by Splunk TA for Azure or Microsoft Cloud Services
- Install this TA on your Splunk Heavy Forwarder or SplunkCloud Victoria Ad Hoc (collector) node
- Under Configuration, enter the Client ID under username and Client Secret in the password
- Under Input, 
   - Give it a unique name that describe your use case
   - For interval, I recommend doing this very infrequently, like ""once per day"" or 86400
   - Specify your index
   - Under `Group Display Name Keyword`, give it the search keyword that will match Groups' `displayName`
      - For example, if you have heaps of groups that are named ""*SNOW USERS*"", such as ""LATAM-SNOW-USERS"", ""EMEA-SNOW-USERS"", ""APAC-SNOW-USERS"", enter in the textfield the value _SNOW USERS_
   - Enter the Tenant ID

# sendtohec Custom Search Command

A custom SPL Search Command that allows you to forward results of a Splunk Search to a Second Splunk indexer via HTTP Event Collector (HEC). A GUI is provided to configure the Search Command.

### Syntax

     | sendtohec traget=

where *target* is the configured Splunk indexer that serves as the destination.


## Usage

### Prerequisites
- One Splunk instance acting as the sender
- Another Splunk instance acting as the receiver, from now on referred to as ""target""

### Setup
1. On the sending Splunk Instance, install the *sendtohec Custom Search Command* app.
2. Set up a HTTP Event Collector on the target instance. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) for Splunk Enterprise, and [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) for Splunk Cloud.
3. On the sending Splunk Instance, open the *sendtohec Custom Search Command* app. You will be redirected to the *Configuration* page, where you can configure one or multiple targets.
4. Click on the **Add** button to configure a new target.
Specify a name for the target. This name will be invoked with the Search Command. For the *Receiving Instance Base URl* field, provide the full URL of the target instance including preceeding *http* or *https*, but without port. You can specify a port in the next field, if this is omitted, the default value of 8088 is used. Next provide the HEC token. If you with to preserve some internal fields when sending events, you can specify them in the *Fields to Include* field.
5. Change to the *Search* page in the app, or to the default *Search & Reporting* app, and use the configured target according to the syntax described above.",false,"Splunk Works",splunklabs,false,12,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png",7162,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,sgt,"Splunk General Terms","https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",sgt,"https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-general-terms.html",64,"",splunk,enterprise,"2024-07-08T20:18:38.634143Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[\r____",Utilities,utilities,1136,0,0,null,"apps.json","_json",Q6HDP2WV94,,developer,,,none,"2024-07-15T10:08:06.966428Z",null

Here's a break down of its functionality:

Dependencies: The code requires several npm packages such as Express (for creating the web server), body-parser (for parsing incoming request bodies), splunk-logging (for interacting with Splunk), and axios (for making HTTP requests).

Express Server Setup: The code initializes an Express application and sets up middleware to parse JSON bodies in incoming requests.

Routes:

GET '/': This route simply sends a response of 'Veracode Splunk Import' for any incoming GET requests. POST '/veracode': This is the main route where Veracode vulnerability data is expected to be sent. Upon receiving a POST request to this route, the code extracts veracode_project_id and veracode_build_id from the request body. Fetching Veracode Build Details: The code constructs a URL to fetch build details from the Veracode API based on the veracode_project_id and veracode_build_id. It then makes an HTTP GET request to this URL, passing along an API key in the headers.

Processing Vulnerability Data: Once the build details are fetched, the code extracts vulnerability information from the response. It then prepares data objects for each vulnerability, containing details such as vulnerability ID, severity, and policy name.

Sending Data to Splunk: For each vulnerability, the code sends an event to Splunk using the splunk.sendEvent method. It appears that it sends events asynchronously, and it awaits all event-sending promises to resolve before proceeding.

Flushing Events to Splunk: After all events are sent, the code flushes the events to Splunk using splunk.flush. It waits for the flush operation to complete and handles any errors that may occur during the process.

Server Initialization: Finally, the code starts listening on the specified port (or port 3000 by default) for incoming HTTP requests. It logs a message indicating that the server has started.

This application essentially acts as a bridge between Veracode and Splunk, allowing Veracode vulnerability data to be imported into Splunk for analysis or monitoring. It leverages asynchronous processing to handle potentially large amounts of data efficiently.",false,"Vincent  Hinojosa","vhinojosa@veracode.com",false,12,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/78e13398-e775-11ee-aa20-f286b501bd90.png",7277,searcher,"Learn More","https://github.com/veracodevince/splunk",0,false,true,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",68,"",splunk,,"2024-03-22T07:28:48.988642Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_""----"",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[]","Vulnerability Scanner

Qmulos Apple Compliance addresses the needs of the macOS Security Compliance Project. The app enables enterprises to continuously assess and manage the control posture of macOS systems at the organizational and system-level in enterprises of any size!

Comprehensive Coverage for Today’s Mandates and Beyond
Qmulos Apple Compliance leverages NIST SP 800-219 (macOS Security Compliance Project) to enable macOS endpoint visibility through specific security baselines. The compliance state of macOS systems is evaluated against a range of domains including Audit, Authentication, iCloud, Operating System, Password Policy, System Preferences, and other control categories. Additionally, the Qmulos Apple Compliance integration enables Compliance Scans against macOS systems using a wide selection of baselines reflective of industry-standard frameworks.

Available baselines include:
* Revision 5 of NIST 800-53 (Low, Moderate, High)
* 800-171
* CIS Level 1
* CIS Level 2
* CIS Version 8
* CNSSI-1253
* DISA-STIG
* Qmulos Apple Compliance is fully integrated with existing Qmulos products such as the Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk and Q-Compliance.

We have ensured that the macOS Compliance Scans, the primary driving force behind the Qmulos Apple Compliance integration, are compatible with the Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk. Seamless automation, reduced manual overhead, streamlined compliance lifecycle – all delivered through an easy-to-use graphic interface that doesn’t require your staff to be experts in macOS, Splunk, or compliance frameworks!

Additionally, macOS Compliance Scan rules are all mapped to NIST 800-53 controls, enabling control-specific granularity. The Qmulos SCAP App for Splunk provides rule-to-control mappings, SCAP benchmark and CCE uploads, and visualizations including a NIST 800-53 Score Card, Benchmarks Overview, and Enterprise Overview. Furthermore, macOS Compliance Scans are also integrated with Q-Compliance, and are visualized under the Security Scan Statistics panels which are supported by state-of-the-art Qmulos Alert Management functionality.

As enterprises continue to increasingly embrace Apple devices, maintaining a holistic understanding of the compliance state of macOS systems becomes a mission-critical objective. By leveraging Qmulos Apple Compliance and the macOS Security and Compliance Project, macOS systems can leverage all the operational compliance functionality and the frictionless compliance management experience delivered through the power of the Qmulos Converged Continuous Compliance™ platform.",false,"Qmulos LLC",Qmulos,false,29,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/image/default_icon.png",6744,searcher,"Learn More","https://www.qmulos.com/qmulos-apple-compliance-enterprise-compliance-scanning-for-macos",0,false,true,false,false,none,none,"",none,"",68,"",splunk,,"2023-04-17T16:11:18.121283Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_""----"",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[]","Endpoint

Requirements

This app requires a couple of python packages installable with pip. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to get them:

The installed packages are:

tweepy
speedtest-cli
This app also requires a twitter app / developer account. Sign up and create your own at dev.twitter.com (its free)

Once that has been created you will need to update ./etc/speedtest.conf

Required details needed are as follows:

Subscribed ISP service level in MBps down/up
ISP twitter handle
twitter app consumer_key
twitter app consumer_secret
twitter access_token
twitter access_token_secret
Splunk HTTP Event Collector Token

This is the fourth iteration of our product, the same product that we've integrated in telecoms, financial institutions, air traffic controls, across myriad industries, often in mission-critical environments. We can't afford to build a bad product, not just because of our customers, but because we use Infigo SIEM as the heart of our managed security services.

Do you have a simple XML dashboard where you want the dashboard results sent via email/slack/etc regularly?
Do you wish that a dashboard's results could be summarised and tracked over time?

Typically you need to copy the search logic into saved searches to accomplish these goals. Duplicating the logic creates extra maintenance and is error-prone because it does not follow the DRY (Don't repeat yourself https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle of software development. You could reach for a macro (or similar) to store search logic, however, now you have logic in numerous places and it's still difficult to maintain. 

With Dashrunner you can now store all the logic in one place, inside the dashboard, using hidden tokens.

Scheduled Searches can be improperly set to where the time span of the search and the  scheduling differ. This leads to the potential of missed alerts and events or wasteful searches that are taxing your Splunk system with overlapping time spans. 

Scheduled Searches can also lose their ‘owner’ and become an orphaned search, decreasing visibility and longevity of the environment. Atlas not only automatically identifies these problematic searches but enables easy access to them for further investigation. Scheduling Inspector also provides an automation feature that will quickly remedy the issues it discovers, enabling your Admins to quickly optimize their environment.

Scheduling Inspector is a component of the Atlas Platform. The Atlas Platform is focused on helping Splunk owners achieve outcomes from their Splunk investment rapidly with prebuilt solutions that address common use-cases, tools that support common workflows, and automation tools that enable Splunk Admins and their Users to do more in less time. Atlas also comes with Expertise on Demand, which gives you access to Splunk experts who can assist you and your Splunk Team with building out use cases and for support of the Atlas and Splunk platforms.

This Python script is designed to collect information about users who are members of groups exempted from conditional access policies in Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD). It interacts with the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve data about conditional access policies and their exempted groups, and then fetches the members of these groups.

## Releases
Version 2.0.0 was released on 4-July 2024. It now uses Splunk AOB and is more accurate in retrieving users. The caveat in this version it no longers includes any other user info aside from the user's Azure AD unique ID.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Retrieves information about conditional access policies and exempted groups from Microsoft Azure AD using the Microsoft Graph API.
- **Policy Matching**: Filters conditional access policies based on a provided regular expression pattern.
- **User Retrieval**: Fetches members of exempted groups and collects information about them.
- **Output Formatting**: Outputs collected user information in JSON format suitable for consumption by other systems or storage in Splunk.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following:

- **Microsoft Azure AD**: You must have access to an Azure AD instance and appropriate permissions to query conditional access policies and group memberships.
- **Registered Application**: You need to register an application in Azure AD and obtain its client ID and client secret. This application must have appropriate permissions to access the Microsoft Graph API.
- **Python Environment**: This script requires a Python environment with necessary dependencies installed, such as `requests` and `splunklib`.

CCX Security Operations has taken it upon ourselves to improve the existing non-public Splunk Add-on ""Symantec ProxySG App for Splunk"" (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2815) as to ensure it is as CIM compliant as possible.

This TA does not replace the official  Splunk Add-on for ""Symantec ProxySG App for Splunk"", but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional field extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetype:

Spend less time searching and more time logically drilling down to determine how events correlate to form a story.

Too often we see customers struggling with these challenges:
- SOC teams spending hours focused on clearing noise instead of focusing on real problems 
- Bouncing from view to view trying to isolate events that caused problems
- Struggling to build a timeline of events to determine if an issue is real or a false positive
- Correlation that is less about correlating different triggering events and more about identifying something that might be considered ""notable""

The Patronus SIEM provides security teams the ability to easily monitor, detect and react to security concerns based on a scoring system that highlights notables and filters out the noise. Spend less time searching and more time logically drilling down to determine how events correlate to form a story.  

A basic scoring system was put in place which applies a certain level of risk to ALL detections.  Those detections become compelling as they grow in score and then generate an incident after a prescribed threshold is exceeded.

We believe that many events generate an incident and a timeline vs every incident representing a single event. This greatly reduces the time spent in lifecycle management and chasing false positives.

Quite simply, time is the asset that is most important to a security team.  
- Time to detection
- Time to investigation
- Time to remediate 

Key Features

Executive View
- There is always an owner for your security team that doesn't care about the details
- High level details of incidents, risks and threats identified

Score based incident generation
- Noise reduction
- Cross-layer risk generation makes for a more reliable incident. Focuses more on the score of the many vs the score of one

Incident Management
- Immutable note taking for incident reporting
- Organized operations for your SOC

Threat Hunting Scoreboard
- The Patronus Scoreboard provides a single real-time view of risk generating activities
- Timeline view for risk objects as well as risk generating events
- Drilldown to the records generating risk all in a single view",false,"Spico Solutions","dev@spico-labs.com",false,48,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/0dcfef48-c8a8-11eb-b5cb-02c65895b235.png",5588,searcher,"Learn More","https://spicosolutions.com/patronus-app/",0,false,true,false,false,"","","","","",64,"",splunk,enterprise,"2021-06-11T00:24:38.293040Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_""----"",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[\r","Security, Fraud & Compliance","security_compliance",1906,5,1,null,"apps.json","_json",Q6HDP2WV94,,developer,,,none,"2024-01-18T18:51:02.917454Z",null

However, to truly realize the value of Splunk Enterprise Security you must ensure that you are ingesting the data sources required to populate the ES dashboards. Without the appropriate data onboarded into your Splunk implementation, ES cannot deliver the value that it should. More importantly, identifying the data sources and prioritizing which data should be brought in first is typically where customers get stuck when attempting to implement ES. A stalled ES implementation leads to valuable time that is lost leaving your organization in a vulnerable state.

Atlas ES Helper is designed to provide you with expert guidance for achieving a successful ES deployment by helping you to identify the data sources that are required to get the real value out of Splunk’s Enterprise Security platform. ES Helper tracks your progress and provides a scoring mechanism that will show you the health of your ES deployment by analyzing your Splunk system.

Atlas ES Helper is a component of the Atlas Platform. ES Helper works with both Splunk Enterprise on premise and Splunk Cloud. The Atlas Platform is focused on helping Splunk owners achieve outcomes from their Splunk investment rapidly with prebuilt solutions that address common use-cases, tools that support common workflows, and automation tools that enable Splunk Admins and their Users to do more in less time. Atlas also comes with Expertise on Demand, which gives you access to Splunk experts who can assist you and your Splunk Team with building out use cases and for support of the Atlas and Splunk platforms.

With 97% prediction accuracy and less than 0.01% false-positives, Augur provides unparalleled security and operational efficiency.

Adversary Profiling Means Better Protection
We are continually building and monitoring a pool of more than 10,000 adversary profiles. We identify new adversaries almost daily. Continuous surveillance means we know when they go live on day zero, and levels the playing field by removing the element of surprise. Adversary profiles also mean we can cover a much broader spectrum of potential threats from the same actor, as opposed to most TIPs which simply alert you of a specific threat when it's already knocking at your network door.

Automated Threat Response
The other radical thing Augur does is it generates Indicators of Attack associated with these future threats. Through our integrations with major security solutions, Augur is able to integrate blacklists into your firewalls, web proxies, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems, DNS servers, and Email gateways. Protecting you against malicious traffic before there is any risk. And when an attack origin is no longer malicious or there is a false positive, we automatically update our blacklists and adjust your security posture.

In a mature Splunk environment it is not uncommon to have scheduled searches that run concurrently using up valuable resources your Splunk environment needs to serve your Splunk users. When your Splunk users are competing with scheduled searches, your users are waiting in the search queue for resources to become available to execute their search or display their dashboard or report. Worse yet, when you have concurrency spikes in your Splunk environment, your searches might be skipped causing critical alerts to not run at all!

Atlas Scheduling Assistant is a powerful tool that not only shows you where scheduled search concurrency exists in your Splunk environment, but also provides you with tools that automatically recommend how to resolve this problem and then gives you the tools to automatically fix the problem. The eliminates the need for Splunk Administrators to spend countless hours searching for and manually testing changes to optimize search schedules. With Scheduling Assistant you can reduce the time to optimization of scheduled searches from days to minutes giving valuable time back to your Splunk Administration Team.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on for Tenable Products looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Tenable log sources captured via ""Tenable Add-On for Splunk"" and ""Tenable WAS Add-On for Splunk"".

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for Tenable (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4060) or Tenable WAS Add-On for Splunk (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/6884) but works as an additonal extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes:
- ""tenable:ot:alerts"" (Tenable.ot)
- ""tenable:io:vuln:was"" (Tenable WAS)

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

Features:
- This TA currently supports logtypes tagged under the following CIM datamodels: Alerts, Authentication, Change, Data Access, Intrusion Detection (IDS), Malware, Network Traffic, and Vulnerability .",false,"Henrique Linsmeyer",henriquelinsmeyer,false,106,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/278306b2-2ed2-11ef-9603-4ec8ee97c7e7.png",7122,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,customer,"Customer License Agreement for App","http://www.cybercx.com.au",customer,"http://www.cybercx.com.au",65,"",splunk,"enterprise

The common approach to using the Splunk Threat Research Team's over 1600 detections is to clone out each one that you want to use, but when you clone it out, how do you check back to verify if a later version of ESCU has updated it so you can take advantage of better detection logic or bug fixes?

That's where the ESCU Companion App comes in. Using new features provided by ES 8.0 (but functional in ES 7.0!) the Splunk Threat Research Team has added metadata fields to their ESCU project. The ESCU Companion App uses those metadata fields with some simple dashboards so you can monitor your cloned detections and see which needs to be modified. There is also an alert configured, that you can schedule and add actions such as email or other custom actions (ansible playbooks, SOAR automation, etc.) to instantly notify or take action when a search is detected as being a different version than the ESCU version.

This add-on can be configured to monitor any type of data source within a Splunk environment, and when a specific event or condition occurs, it triggers an alert using 'nimalarm' to send it to the CA UIM system. The 'nimalarm' utility ensures that the alert is delivered in a timely and efficient manner, and can be customized to meet the specific needs of each user. With this add-on, users can proactively manage their data, detect and respond to issues quickly, and ensure that critical events are immediately communicated to the CA UIM system for further action. This can help users to improve their overall Splunk experience, and ensure that they are able to effectively manage their IT infrastructure.

Install this add-on as per the Splunk documented guidelines. 

Usage:
1. Create a search and save it as an alert. 
2. Select trigger condition: ""Nimbus alert in Splunk""
3. Fill-in the required details and save it.

Note:
1. Should have Nimbus agent installed in your system.
2. Ensure 'nimalert' is stored under /opt/nimbus/bin/nimalarm, if not, you can change the path in TA-nimbusalerting/bin/nimbus.sh.

It's painful to search through these log sources when you need them the most, like when you are investigating threats or debugging outages.

Solution: Scanner provides custom search commands in Splunk that let you to query these logs in object storage at high speed. Get answers ASAP, and continue to use Splunk as your single pane of glass. Build reports and dashboards in Splunk that combine results from Splunk and from object storage logs. Your logs in object storage are no longer a blind spot.

The high-volume log sources in object storage are now searchable from Splunk using custom commands. Scanner allows you to search at high speed, especially for needle-in-haystack queries. For example, searching a 100TB log data set for a list of IP addresses, emails, or UUIDs takes only 10 seconds in Scanner. Running the same search in a 1PB log data set takes about 100 seconds. This can be 10-100x faster than tools like Athena, especially against raw JSON logs that have not yet been highly optimized with Parquet and partitioning.

To get started, you will need to sign up for a Scanner instance. When that is ready, there is a setup page in the Splunk app that allows you to set up Scanner API keys and assign them to Splunk roles. Scanner uses the ""storage passwords"" feature of Splunk to store API keys, so roles that interact with Scanner will need the ""list_storage_passwords"" capability.

If you want Splunk to be your single pane of glass where you can analyze both Splunk logs and the logs you have in object storage, Scanner can help you make this happen.

Using Scanner, you can run fast queries against your object storage logs, join them against your Splunk logs, create dashboards from object storage logs, and more.

With your object storage logs easily queryable from Splunk, you can avoid blind spots and get answers rapidly.",false,"Clifton Crosland","ctc@scanner.dev",false,130,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/93c15da8-1f67-11ef-8cf7-baac2e8c80c3.png",7301,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",71,"",splunk,"enterprise

Security Posture	          Use cases to detect and remediate flaws in securing the applications in the network. 
                                          This gives visibility into weak cipher, untrusted certificates,  signature algorithms

Anomalous Traffic	          Detect and remediate challenges with DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic in the network

Troubleshooting	          Detect and remediate network delay, connectivity, and protocol errors in the network. 
                                          For ex server vs network latency, TCP Ip connectivity issues, DNS issues.

Suspicious Activities 	  Detect and remediate issues related to unmanaged devices, suspicious connections,
                                          and traffic outside norms in  the network. 
                                          For ex: IOT unmanaged devices, unwanted services and port misuse

Rogue Activities	          Detect and remediate unsanctioned applications that can pose challenges to your network and security. 
                                          Ex: Unsanctioned p2p Apps, crypto jacking.

The app deletes the db_ and rb_ folders with specified age according to the configurations in the inputs.conf  and frozen.conf files.

This app should be installed on the Indexer servers. Currently this app supports Indexers installed on nix servers.


Important Note: 

	Always consider organization’s data retention policies while setting up the configurations.
	
	Make sure to give the exact Frozen path configured in Splunk. Wrong path may lead to the removal of unintended data.

The KO Disablement app is designed to streamline the management of Splunk knowledge objects such as saved searches, reports, and dashboards. It empowers Splunk administrators and users to efficiently enable, disable, or delete knowledge objects within their Splunk environment. By providing a user-friendly interface and powerful functionality, this app simplifies the often time-consuming and complex task of managing knowledge objects.

Motivation:
Splunk is a powerful platform for analyzing and visualizing data, but as organizations scale and data grows, managing knowledge objects can become challenging. Without a dedicated tool, administrators and users may find themselves manually handling each object, which is inefficient and error-prone. The KO Disablement app aims to address this pain point by offering an intuitive solution that saves time, reduces errors, and enhances overall productivity.

Problem Statement:
The KO Disablement app addresses the critical need for a more efficient and user-friendly approach to managing knowledge objects within Splunk. The platform's native management features may lack the flexibility, speed, and convenience required to handle the volume and complexity of knowledge objects in large Splunk environments. As a result, administrators and users may struggle with:

- Cumbersome Processes: Manually enabling, disabling, or deleting individual knowledge objects is time-consuming and prone to human error.
- Lack of Centralized Control: Administrators may find it difficult to monitor and manage knowledge objects across various apps and users efficiently.
- Tedious Troubleshooting: Identifying and resolving issues with knowledge objects scattered throughout the system can be a challenging and time-intensive task.

The KO Disablement app addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, user-friendly interface to enable, disable, and delete knowledge objects across Splunk. With its powerful functionalities, users can seamlessly manage their Splunk environment, improve productivity, and ensure the accuracy and efficiency of their data analysis and visualization processes.

Try the KO Disablement app today to experience a smoother, faster, and more effective way of managing knowledge objects, unleashing the true potential of your Splunk environment. Simplify your Splunk management and elevate your data analysis capabilities like never before!",false,"Cody Quinney",quinneyc,false,146,err0r,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/aa45da12-2cac-11ee-abcf-3676bf61eaa0.png",6986,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",64,"",splunk,enterprise,"2023-07-28T09:47:44.474076Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[\r____",Utilities,utilities,1067,5,2,null,"apps.json","_json",Q6HDP2WV94,,developer,error,error,none,"2023-08-11T09:17:20.754322Z",null

Each search comes with a description and an explanation to further elaborate what the search achieves. Users and Admins can also add their own searches to the library, to share searches that are relevant for their own use cases and assist new users in interacting with their data.

Search Library is a powerful tool that can enable collaboration for Splunk users and administrators. Having a catalog of effective optimized searches that perform well and get you to the data you need faster is critical for activating the Splunk platform in any Splunk Environment.

Atlas Search Library is a component of the Atlas Platform. The Atlas Platform is focused on helping Splunk owners achieve outcomes from their Splunk investment rapidly with prebuilt solutions that address common use-cases, tools that support common workflows, and automation tools that enable Splunk Admins and their Users to do more in less time. Atlas also comes with Expertise on Demand, which gives you access to Splunk experts who can assist you and your Splunk Team with building out use cases and for support of the Atlas and Splunk platforms.

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Extensions for Palo Alto Firewall Add-on looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Palo Alto Firewall log sources parsed via the Add-on Palo Alto Networks Add-on for Splunk.

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for Palo Alto Networks Add-on for Splunk (https://classic.splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2757) but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes:  
- pan:globalprotect
- pan_globalprotect
- pan:iot_alert
- pan:iot_vulnerability
- pan:iot_device

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

Features:
- This TA currently supports logtypes tagged under the following CIM datamodels: Alerts, Authentication, Change, Endpoint, Inventory, Intrusion Detection (IDS), Network Sessions, Network Traffic, and Vulnerabilities.",false,"Henrique Linsmeyer",henriquelinsmeyer,false,171,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/ca52c6b4-aa86-11ee-a398-0abdc1914aaf.png",7054,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,customer,"Customer License Agreement for App","http://www.cybercx.com.au",customer,"http://www.cybercx.com.au",65,"",splunk,"enterprise

The data is created as the well known wordpress WAF plugin ""wordfence"" by Defiant Inc detects attack patterns on the website itself. It is then transferred to the splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC). There it can be correlated with other security information relevant for your organization or its processes. The ingestion via python skript + HEC (see ![gitlab](https://gitlab.com/splunk-apps-uns/wfence)) does work even for *-as-a-service offerings, where you are not allowed to work with the splunk universal forwarder.  

## Use Cases
The wfence App for Splunk provides dashboards to visualize attack data in Splunk, announcing critical situations such as:
* missing patches
* Potential administrator login takeover
* Brute force attacks on the login pages
* Potential integrity loss on the website
* attack distribution patterns over certain users over time
* distribution of attacking clients based on IP Geolocation services",false,"Christian Breitenstrom",cbreitenstrom,false,174,,no,Q6HDP2WV94,"https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/media/public/icons/b7183bd2-6045-11ee-9b4a-a2e097ac947e.png",7048,searcher,"Learn More","",0,false,false,false,false,"3rd_party_eula","Splunk End User License for Third Party Content","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html","3rd_party_eula","https://cdn.splunkbase.splunk.com/static/misc/eula.html",70,"",splunk,enterprise,"2023-10-04T09:46:35.080588Z","{\r____"""":_,\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_"""",\r____"""":_[\r____","Security, Fraud & Compliance

CyberCX is Australia’s greatest force of cyber security experts. Our highly skilled professional services team operates a 24x7 on-shore security operations centre (SOC) servicing corporate and public sector organisations across Australia and New Zealand, specialising in Security Operations services leveraging Splunk.

Description:
The CCX Add-on for Rapid7 Products Extensions looks to provide additional field extraction and CIM compliance for Rapid7 log sources captured via the Add-on Rapid7 InsightVM Technology Add-On for Splunk or Rapid7 Nexpose Technology Add-On for Splunk.

This Technical Add-on does not replace the public Splunk Add-on for Rapid7 InsightVM (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5097) or Rapid7 Nexpose (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3457) but works as an additional extension to be deployed on Search Heads (only).

Currently this add-on provides additional extraction and CIM compliance for sourcetypes:  

- rapid7:nexpose:vuln
- rapid7:insightvm:asset
- rapid7:insightvm:asset:vulnerability_finding
- rapid7:insightvm:vulnerability_definition

Fully compatible with Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, built by an Ops team for Ops teams.

- Stores data in the Splunk Metric Store (as opposed to an Event Index),
- Supports Splunk Cloud to AppDynamics SaaS connectivity, meaning you do not need shuffle your data to and from private networks
- Easy configuration with simple toggles to control which apps and data types are ingested, based on Google SRE golden signals to target metrics for each type
- Support for all metric types including Application Monitoring (APM), End User Monitoring (EUM), Databases, Servers & Analytics
- Support for multiple controllers, with configuration of HEC endpoint and metric indexes per controller.

This addon doesn't intend to replicate all of AppDynamics' rich diagnostic and metric data into Splunk but targets key metrics to allow you to provide unified summary dashboards alongside your other data and to leverage key metrics in ITSI.
